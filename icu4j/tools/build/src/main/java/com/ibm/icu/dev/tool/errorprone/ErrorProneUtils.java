     * This is from errorprone library, a list of all known issue types.
     *
     * The reason why we need all of this complication:
     *
     * The errorprone tool is implemented as a javac compiler extension.
     * So when the code is compiled, the errorprone "hooks" are invoked by the
     * Java compiler.
     * As such, errorprone can only use the Java compiler mechanisms to report issues.
     * But if it reports an error, the compiler stops compiling the rest of the files.
     * In order to generate a report on the whole source tree, errorprone has a flag
     * to report all issues as warnings (-XepAllErrorsAsWarnings).
     * That way the compiler continues on the whole project and does not stop.
     * But because of that, even the worst errorprone violations that would qualify
     * as errors are still reported as warnings.
     * So to "get back" the proper severity level we depend on the errorprone library,
     * get all known errors, and then use the `defaultSeverity` field within each `BugCheckerInfo`.
