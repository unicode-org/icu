    // Spellout rules for various languages
    //
    // The following RuleBasedNumberFormat descriptions show the rules for
    // spelling out numeric values in various languages.  As mentioned
    // before, we cannot vouch for the accuracy or completeness of this
    // data, although we believe it's pretty close.  Basically, this
    // represents one day's worth of Web-surfing.  If you can supply the
    // missing information in any of these rule sets, or if you find errors,
    // or if you can supply spellout rules for languages that aren't shown
    // here, we want to hear from you!
    //========================================================================

    /**
     * Spellout rules for U.S. English.  This demonstration version of the
     * U.S. English spellout rules has four variants: 1) %simplified is a
     * set of rules showing the simple method of spelling out numbers in
     * English: 289 is formatted as "two hundred eighty-nine".  2) %alt-teens
     * is the same as %simplified, except that values between 1,000 and 9,999
     * whose hundreds place isn't zero are formatted in hundreds.  For example,
     * 1,983 is formatted as "nineteen hundred eighty-three," and 2,183 is
     * formatted as "twenty-one hundred eighty-three," but 2,083 is still
     * formatted as "two thousand eighty-three."  3) %ordinal formats the
     * values as ordinal numbers in English (e.g., 289 is "two hundred eighty-
     * ninth").  4) %default uses a more complicated algorithm to format
     * numbers in a more natural way: 289 is formatted as "two hundred AND
     * eighty-nine" and commas are inserted between the thousands groups for
     * values above 100,000.

            + "formatted as \"twenty-one hundred eighty-three,\" but 2,083 is still "
            + "formatted as \"two thousand eighty-three.\"  3) %ordinal formats the "
            + "values as ordinal numbers in English (e.g., 289 is \"two hundred eighty-"
            + "ninth\").  4) %default uses a more complicated algorithm to format "
            + "numbers in a more natural way: 289 is formatted as \"two hundred AND "
            + "eighty-nine\" and commas are inserted between the thousands groups for "
            + "values above 100,000.",

            "U.K. English has one significant "
            + "difference from U.S. English: the names for values of 1,000,000,000 "
            + "and higher.  In American English, each successive \"-illion\" is 1,000 "
            + "times greater than the preceding one: 1,000,000,000 is \"one billion\" "
            + "and 1,000,000,000,000 is \"one trillion.\"  In British English, each "
            + "successive \"-illion\" is one million times greater than the one before: "
            + "\"one billion\" is 1,000,000,000,000 (or what Americans would call a "
            + "\"trillion\"), and \"one trillion\" is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.  "
            + "1,000,000,000 in British English is \"one thousand million.\"  (This "
            + "value is sometimes called a \"milliard,\" but this word seems to have "
            + "fallen into disuse.)",

            "The Spanish rules are quite similar to "
            + "the English rules, but there are some important differences: "
            + "First, we have to provide separate rules for most of the twenties "
            + "because the ones digit frequently picks up an accent mark that it "
            + "doesn't have when standing alone.  Second, each multiple of 100 has "
            + "to be specified separately because the multiplier on 100 very often "
            + "changes form in the contraction: 500 is \"quinientos,\" not "
            + "\"cincocientos.\"  In addition, the word for 100 is \"cien\" when "
            + "standing alone, but changes to \"ciento\" when followed by more digits.  "
            + "There also some other differences.",

            "French adds some interesting quirks of its "
            + "own: 1) The word \"et\" is interposed between the tens and ones digits, "
            + "but only if the ones digit if 1: 20 is \"vingt,\" and 2 is \"vingt-deux,\" "
            + "but 21 is \"vingt-et-un.\"  2)  There are no words for 70, 80, or 90.  "
            + "\"quatre-vingts\" (\"four twenties\") is used for 80, and values proceed "
            + "by score from 60 to 99 (e.g., 73 is \"soixante-treize\" [\"sixty-thirteen\"]).  "
            + "Numbers from 1,100 to 1,199 are rendered as hundreds rather than "
            + "thousands: 1,100 is \"onze cents\" (\"eleven hundred\"), rather than "
            + "\"mille cent\" (\"one thousand one hundred\")",

            "Swiss French differs from French French "
            + "in that it does have words for 70, 80, and 90.  This rule set shows them, "
            + "and is simpler as a result.",

            "German also adds some interesting "
            + "characteristics.  For values below 1,000,000, numbers are customarily "
            + "written out as a single word.  And the ones digit PRECEDES the tens "
            + "digit (e.g., 23 is \"dreiundzwanzig,\" not \"zwanzigunddrei\").",

            "Like German, most Italian numbers are "
            + "written as single words.  What makes these rules complicated is the rule "
            + "that says that when a word ending in a vowel and a word beginning with "
            + "a vowel are combined into a compound, the vowel is dropped from the "
            + "end of the first word: 180 is \"centottanta,\" not \"centoottanta.\"  "
            + "The complexity of this rule set is to produce this behavior.",

            "Spellout rules for Swedish.",

            "Spellout rules for Dutch.  Notice that in Dutch, as in German,"
            + "the ones digit precedes the tens digit.",

            "In Japanese, there really isn't any "
            + "distinction between a number written out in digits and a number "
            + "written out in words: the ideographic characters are both digits "
            + "and words.  This rule set provides two variants:  %traditional "
            + "uses the traditional CJK numerals (which are also used in China "
            + "and Korea).  %financial uses alternate ideographs for many numbers "
            + "that are harder to alter than the traditional numerals (one could "
            + "fairly easily change a one to "
            + "a three just by adding two strokes, for example).  This is also done in "
            + "the other countries using Chinese ideographs, but different ideographs "
            + "are used in those places.",

            "Again in Greek we have to supply the words "
            + "for the multiples of 100 because they can't be derived algorithmically.  "
            + "Also, the tens dgit changes form when followed by a ones digit: an "
            + "accent mark disappears from the tens digit and moves to the ones digit.  "
