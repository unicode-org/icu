        // to normalize the relevant substring ("b\u0327")and compare the result to the
        // original.  the original code was passing in the start and length of the
        // substring (3, 5-3 = 2) but the called code was expecting start and limit.
        // it subtracted the start again to get what it thought was the length, but
        // ended up with -1.  the loop was incrementing an index from 0 and testing
        // against length, but 0 was never == -1 before it walked off the array end.

        // normalize.
