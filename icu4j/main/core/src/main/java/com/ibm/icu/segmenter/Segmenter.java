/**
 * An interface that defines APIs for segmentation in terms of segments and boundaries, and
 * enforces immutable stateless iteration over the segmentation result yielded from an input
 * {@code CharSequence}.
 *
 * <p>{@code Segmenter} is designed to be a followup to the {@code BreakIterator} in providing
 * segmentation functionality. {@code Segmenter} provides immutable iteration, higher level
 * constructs like {@code Segment}s and {@code CharSequence}s as return types, and Java programmer
 * conveniences like {@code Stream}s in its APIs.
 *
 * <p>Iteration over the input sequences is made immutable by separating the design into two parts,
 * each represented by an interface. The {@code Segmenter} interface represents the construction of
 * the object that encapsulates the segmentation logic. The {@link Segments} interface represents
 * the result of segmentation being performed for a specific given input {@code CharSequence}.
 * {@code Segments} APIs also provide {@code Stream}s to support iteration over the segmentation
 * results in a stateless manner.
