/**
 * This class has been deprecated since ICU 2.2.
 * One problem is that this class is not designed to return supplementary characters.
 * Use the Normalizer2 and UCharacter classes instead.
 * <p>
 * <tt>ComposedCharIter</tt> is an iterator class that returns all
 * of the precomposed characters defined in the Unicode standard, along
 * with their decomposed forms.  This is often useful when building
 * data tables (<i>e.g.</i> collation tables) which need to treat composed
 * and decomposed characters equivalently.
 * <p>
 * For example, imagine that you have built a collation table with ordering
 * rules for the {@link Normalizer#DECOMP canonically decomposed} forms of all
 * characters used in a particular language.  When you process input text using
 * this table, the text must first be decomposed so that it matches the form
 * used in the table.  This can impose a performance penalty that may be
 * unacceptable in some situations.
 * <p>
 * You can avoid this problem by ensuring that the collation table contains
 * rules for both the decomposed <i>and</i> composed versions of each character.
 * To do so, use a <tt>ComposedCharIter</tt> to iterate through all of the
 * composed characters in Unicode.  If the decomposition for that character
 * consists solely of characters that are listed in your ruleset, you can
 * add a new rule for the composed character that makes it equivalent to
 * its decomposition sequence.
 * <p>
 * Note that <tt>ComposedCharIter</tt> iterates over a <em>static</em> table
 * of the composed characters in Unicode.  If you want to iterate over the
 * composed characters in a particular string, use {@link Normalizer} instead.
 * <p>
 * When constructing a <tt>ComposedCharIter</tt> there is one
 * optional feature that you can enable or disable:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Normalizer#IGNORE_HANGUL} - Do not iterate over the Hangul
 *          characters and their corresponding Jamo decompositions.
 *          This option is off by default (<i>i.e.</i> Hangul processing is enabled)
 *          since the Unicode standard specifies that Hangul to Jamo 
 *          is a canonical decomposition.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <tt>ComposedCharIter</tt> is currently based on version 2.1.8 of the
 * <a href="http://www.unicode.org" target="unicode">Unicode Standard</a>.
 * It will be updated as later versions of Unicode are released.
