/**
 * <p>A Reader/Writer lock originally written for ICU service
 * implementation. The internal implementation was replaced
 * with the JDK's stock read write lock (ReentrantReadWriteLock)
 * for ICU 52.</p>
 *
 * <p>This assumes that there will be little writing contention.
 * It also doesn't allow active readers to acquire and release
 * a write lock, or deal with priority inversion issues.</p>
 *
 * <p>Access to the lock should be enclosed in a try/finally block
 * in order to ensure that the lock is always released in case of
 * exceptions:<br><pre>
 * try {
 *     lock.acquireRead();
 *     // use service protected by the lock
 * }
 * finally {
 *     lock.releaseRead();
 * }
 * </pre></p>
 *
 * <p>The lock provides utility methods getStats and clearStats
 * to return statistics on the use of the lock.</p>
