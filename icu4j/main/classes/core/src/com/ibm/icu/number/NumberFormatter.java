/**
 * All-in-one formatter for localized numbers, currencies, and units.
 *
 * For a full list of options, see {@link NumberFormatterSettings}.
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Most basic usage:
 * NumberFormatter.withLocale(...).format(123).toString();  // 1,234 in en-US
 *
 * // Custom notation, unit, and rounding strategy:
 * NumberFormatter.with()
 *     .notation(Notation.compactShort())
 *     .unit(Currency.getInstance("EUR"))
 *     .precision(Precision.maxDigits(2))
 *     .locale(...)
 *     .format(1234)
 *     .toString();  // €1.2K in en-US
 *
 * // Create a formatter in a private static final field:
 * private static final LocalizedNumberFormatter formatter = NumberFormatter.withLocale(...)
 *     .unit(NoUnit.PERCENT)
 *     .precision(Precision.fixedFraction(3));
 * formatter.format(5.9831).toString();  // 5.983% in en-US
 *
 * // Create a "template" in a private static final field but without setting a locale until the call site:
 * private static final UnlocalizedNumberFormatter template = NumberFormatter.with()
 *     .sign(SignDisplay.ALWAYS)
 *     .unitWidth(UnitWidth.FULL_NAME);
 * template.locale(...).format(new Measure(1234, MeasureUnit.METER)).toString();  // +1,234 meters in en-US
 * </pre>

 * This API offers more features than {@link com.ibm.icu.text.DecimalFormat} and is geared toward new
 * users of ICU.
 *
 * <p>
 * NumberFormatter instances (i.e., LocalizedNumberFormatter and UnlocalizedNumberFormatter)
 * are immutable and thread safe. This means that invoking a configuration
 * method has no effect on the receiving instance; you must store and use the new number formatter
 * instance it returns instead.
 *
 * <pre>
 * UnlocalizedNumberFormatter formatter = UnlocalizedNumberFormatter.with()
 *         .notation(Notation.scientific());
 * formatter.precision(Precision.maxFraction(2)); // does nothing!
 * formatter.locale(ULocale.ENGLISH).format(9.8765).toString(); // prints "9.8765E0", not "9.88E0"
 * </pre>

 * This API is based on the <em>fluent</em> design pattern popularized by libraries such as Google's

    /**
     * An enum declaring how to resolve conflicts between maximum fraction digits and maximum
     * significant digits.
     *
     * <p>There are two modes, RELAXED and STRICT:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li> RELAXED: Relax one of the two constraints (fraction digits or significant digits) in order
     *   to round the number to a higher level of precision.
     * <li> STRICT: Enforce both constraints, resulting in the number being rounded to a lower
     *   level of precision.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The default settings for compact notation rounding are Max-Fraction = 0 (round to the nearest
     * integer), Max-Significant = 2 (round to 2 significant digits), and priority RELAXED (choose
     * the constraint that results in more digits being displayed).
     *
     * <p>Conflicting *minimum* fraction and significant digits are always resolved in the direction that
     * results in more trailing zeros.
     *
     * <p>Example 1: Consider the number 3.141, with various different settings:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li> Max-Fraction = 1: "3.1"
     * <li> Max-Significant = 3: "3.14"
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The rounding priority determines how to resolve the conflict when both Max-Fraction and
     * Max-Significant are set. With RELAXED, the less-strict setting (the one that causes more digits
     * to be displayed) will be used; Max-Significant wins. With STRICT, the more-strict setting (the
     * one that causes fewer digits to be displayed) will be used; Max-Fraction wins.
     *
     * <p>Example 2: Consider the number 8317, with various different settings:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li> Max-Fraction = 1: "8317"
     * <li> Max-Significant = 3: "8320"
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Here, RELAXED favors Max-Fraction and STRICT favors Max-Significant. Note that this larger
     * number caused the two modes to favor the opposite result.
