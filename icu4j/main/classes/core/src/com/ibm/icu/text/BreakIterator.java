/**
 * {@icuenhanced java.text.BreakIterator}.{@icu _usage_}
 *
 * <p>A class that locates boundaries in text.  This class defines a protocol for
 * objects that break up a piece of natural-language text according to a set
 * of criteria.  Instances or subclasses of BreakIterator can be provided, for
 * example, to break a piece of text into words, sentences, or logical characters
 * according to the conventions of some language or group of languages.
 *
 * We provide five built-in types of BreakIterator:
 * <ul><li>getTitleInstance() returns a BreakIterator that locates boundaries
 * between title breaks.
 * <li>getSentenceInstance() returns a BreakIterator that locates boundaries
 * between sentences.  This is useful for triple-click selection, for example.
 * <li>getWordInstance() returns a BreakIterator that locates boundaries between
 * words.  This is useful for double-click selection or "find whole words" searches.
 * This type of BreakIterator makes sure there is a boundary position at the
 * beginning and end of each legal word.  (Numbers count as words, too.)  Whitespace
 * and punctuation are kept separate from real words.
 * <li>getLineInstance() returns a BreakIterator that locates positions where it is
 * legal for a text editor to wrap lines.  This is similar to word breaking, but
 * not the same: punctuation and whitespace are generally kept with words (you don't
 * want a line to start with whitespace, for example), and some special characters
 * can force a position to be considered a line-break position or prevent a position
 * from being a line-break position.
 * <li>getCharacterInstance() returns a BreakIterator that locates boundaries between
 * logical characters.  Because of the structure of the Unicode encoding, a logical
 * character may be stored internally as more than one Unicode code point.  (A with an
 * umlaut may be stored as an a followed by a separate combining umlaut character,
 * for example, but the user still thinks of it as one character.)  This iterator allows
 * various processes (especially text editors) to treat as characters the units of text
 * that a user would think of as characters, rather than the units of text that the
 * computer sees as "characters".</ul>
 * The text boundary positions are found according to the rules
 * described in Unicode Standard Annex #29, Text Boundaries, and
 * Unicode Standard Annex #14, Line Breaking Properties.  These
 * are available at http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/ and
 * http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/.
 * <p>
 * BreakIterator's interface follows an "iterator" model (hence the name), meaning it
 * has a concept of a "current position" and methods like first(), last(), next(),
 * and previous() that update the current position.  All BreakIterators uphold the
 * following invariants:
 * <ul><li>The beginning and end of the text are always treated as boundary positions.
 * <li>The current position of the iterator is always a boundary position (random-
 * access methods move the iterator to the nearest boundary position before or
 * after the specified position, not _to_ the specified position).
 * <li>DONE is used as a flag to indicate when iteration has stopped.  DONE is only
 * returned when the current position is the end of the text and the user calls next(),
 * or when the current position is the beginning of the text and the user calls
 * previous().
 * <li>Break positions are numbered by the positions of the characters that follow
 * them.  Thus, under normal circumstances, the position before the first character
 * is 0, the position after the first character is 1, and the position after the
 * last character is 1 plus the length of the string.
 * <li>The client can change the position of an iterator, or the text it analyzes,
 * at will, but cannot change the behavior.  If the user wants different behavior, he
 * must instantiate a new iterator.</ul>
 *
 * BreakIterator accesses the text it analyzes through a CharacterIterator, which makes
 * it possible to use BreakIterator to analyze text in any text-storage vehicle that
 * provides a CharacterIterator interface.
 *
 * <b>Note:</b>  Some types of BreakIterator can take a long time to create, and
 * instances of BreakIterator are not currently cached by the system.  For
 * optimal performance, keep instances of BreakIterator around as long as makes
 * sense.  For example, when word-wrapping a document, don't create and destroy a
 * new BreakIterator for each line.  Create one break iterator for the whole document
 * (or whatever stretch of text you're wrapping) and use it to do the whole job of
 * wrapping the text.
 *
  * <P>
 * <strong>Examples</strong>:<P>
 * Creating and using text boundaries
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * public static void main(String args[]) {
 *      if (args.length == 1) {
 *          String stringToExamine = args[0];
 *          //print each word in order
 *          BreakIterator boundary = BreakIterator.getWordInstance();
 *          boundary.setText(stringToExamine);
 *          printEachForward(boundary, stringToExamine);
 *          //print each sentence in reverse order
 *          boundary = BreakIterator.getSentenceInstance(Locale.US);
 *          boundary.setText(stringToExamine);
 *          printEachBackward(boundary, stringToExamine);
 *          printFirst(boundary, stringToExamine);
 *          printLast(boundary, stringToExamine);
 *      }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Print each element in order
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * public static void printEachForward(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
 *     int start = boundary.first();
 *     for (int end = boundary.next();
 *          end != BreakIterator.DONE;
 *          start = end, end = boundary.next()) {
 *          System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Print each element in reverse order
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * public static void printEachBackward(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
 *     int end = boundary.last();
 *     for (int start = boundary.previous();
 *          start != BreakIterator.DONE;
 *          end = start, start = boundary.previous()) {
 *         System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Print first element
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * public static void printFirst(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
 *     int start = boundary.first();
 *     int end = boundary.next();
 *     System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Print last element
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * public static void printLast(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
 *     int end = boundary.last();
 *     int start = boundary.previous();
 *     System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Print the element at a specified position
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * public static void printAt(BreakIterator boundary, int pos, String source) {
 *     int end = boundary.following(pos);
 *     int start = boundary.previous();
 *     System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Find the next word
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * public static int nextWordStartAfter(int pos, String text) {
 *     BreakIterator wb = BreakIterator.getWordInstance();
 *     wb.setText(text);
 *     int wordStart = wb.following(pos);
 *     for (;;) {
 *         int wordLimit = wb.next();
 *         if (wordLimit == BreakIterator.DONE) {
 *             return BreakIterator.DONE;
 *         }
 *         int wordStatus = wb.getRuleStatus();
 *         if (wordStatus != BreakIterator.WORD_NONE) {
 *             return wordStart;
 *         }
 *         wordStart = wordLimit;
 *      }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * The iterator returned by {@link #getWordInstance} is unique in that
 * the break positions it returns don't represent both the start and end of the
 * thing being iterated over.  That is, a sentence-break iterator returns breaks
 * that each represent the end of one sentence and the beginning of the next.
 * With the word-break iterator, the characters between two boundaries might be a
 * word, or they might be the punctuation or whitespace between two words.  The
 * above code uses {@link #getRuleStatus} to identify and ignore boundaries associated
 * with punctuation or other non-word characters.
