/**
 * The core interface implemented by all matchers used for number parsing.
 *
 * Given a string, there should NOT be more than one way to consume the string with the same matcher
 * applied multiple times. If there is, the non-greedy parsing algorithm will be unhappy and may enter an
 * exponential-time loop. For example, consider the "A Matcher" that accepts "any number of As". Given
 * the string "AAAA", there are 2^N = 8 ways to apply the A Matcher to this string: you could have the A
 * Matcher apply 4 times to each character; you could have it apply just once to all the characters; you
 * could have it apply to the first 2 characters and the second 2 characters; and so on. A better version
 * of the "A Matcher" would be for it to accept exactly one A, and allow the algorithm to run it
 * repeatedly to consume a string of multiple As. The A Matcher can implement the Flexible interface
 * below to signal that it can be applied multiple times in a row.
