/**
 * A class for formatting names of people.  Takes raw name data for a person and renders it into a string according to
 * the caller's specifications, taking into account how people's names are rendered in the caller's locale.
 *
 * The Length, Usage, and Formality options can be used to get a wide variety of results.  In English, they would
 * produce results along these lines:
 *
 * |        | REFERRING             | REFERRING    | ADDRESSING | ADDRESSING | MONOGRAM | MONOGRAM |
 * |        | FORMAL                | INFORMAL     | FORMAL     | INFORMAL   | FORMAL   | INFORMAL |
 * |--------|-----------------------|--------------|------------|------------|----------|----------|
 * | LONG   | James Earl Carter Jr. | Jimmy Carter | Mr. Carter | Jimmy      | JEC      | JC       |
 * | MEDIUM | James E. Carter Jr.   | Jimmy Carter | Mr. Carter | Jimmy      | C        | J        |
 * | SHORT  | J. E. Carter          | Jimmy Carter | Mr. Carter | Jimmy      | C        | J        |
