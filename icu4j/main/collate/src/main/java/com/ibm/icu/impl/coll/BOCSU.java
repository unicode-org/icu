/**
 * <p>Binary Ordered Compression Scheme for Unicode</p>
 * 
 * <p>Users are strongly encouraged to read the ICU paper on 
 * <a href="http://www.icu-project.org/docs/papers/binary_ordered_compression_for_unicode.html">
 * BOCU</a> before attempting to use this class.</p>
 * 
 * <p>BOCU is used to compress unicode text into a stream of unsigned
 * bytes.  For many kinds of text the compression compares favorably
 * to UTF-8, and for some kinds of text (such as CJK) it does better.
 * The resulting bytes will compare in the same order as the original
 * code points.  The byte stream does not contain the values 0, 1, or
 * 2.</p>
 * 
 * <p>One example of a use of BOCU is in 
 * com.ibm.icu.text.Collator#getCollationKey(String) for a RuleBasedCollator object with 
 * collation strength IDENTICAL. The result CollationKey will consist of the 
 * collation order of the source string followed by the BOCU result of the 
 * source string. 
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Unlike a UTF encoding, BOCU-compressed text is not suitable for
 * random access.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Method: Slope Detection<br> Remember the previous code point
 * (initial 0).  For each code point in the string, encode the
 * difference with the previous one.  Similar to a UTF, the length of
 * the byte sequence is encoded in the lead bytes.  Unlike a UTF, the
 * trail byte values may overlap with lead/single byte values.  The
 * signedness of the difference must be encoded as the most
 * significant part.</p>
 *
 * <p>We encode differences with few bytes if their absolute values
 * are small.  For correct ordering, we must treat the entire value
 * range -10ffff..+10ffff in ascending order, which forbids encoding
 * the sign and the absolute value separately. Instead, we split the
 * lead byte range in the middle and encode non-negative values going
 * up and negative values going down.</p>
 *
 * <p>For very small absolute values, the difference is added to a
 * middle byte value for single-byte encoded differences.  For
 * somewhat larger absolute values, the difference is divided by the
 * number of byte values available, the modulo is used for one trail
 * byte, and the remainder is added to a lead byte avoiding the
 * single-byte range.  For large absolute values, the difference is
 * similarly encoded in three bytes. (Syn Wee, I need examples
 * here.)</p>
 *
 * <p>BOCU does not use byte values 0, 1, or 2, but uses all other
 * byte values for lead and single bytes, so that the middle range of
 * single bytes is as large as possible.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the lead byte ranges overlap some, but that the
 * sequences as a whole are well ordered. I.e., even if the lead byte
 * is the same for sequences of different lengths, the trail bytes
 * establish correct order.  It would be possible to encode slightly
 * larger ranges for each length (>1) by subtracting the lower bound
 * of the range. However, that would also slow down the calculation.
 * (Syn Wee, need an example).</p>
 *
 * <p>For the actual string encoding, an optimization moves the
 * previous code point value to the middle of its Unicode script block
 * to minimize the differences in same-script text runs.  (Syn Wee,
 * need an example.)</p>
