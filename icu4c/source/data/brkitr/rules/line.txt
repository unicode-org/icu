#         Line Breaking Rules
#         Implement default line breaking as defined by
#         Unicode Standard Annex #14 Revision 37 for Unicode 9.0
#         http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/
#
#         Includes extensions to the handling of emoji ZWJ sequences from
#         https://goo.gl/cluFCn
#
#         TODO:  Rule LB 8 remains as it was in Unicode 5.2
#         This is only because of a limitation of ICU break engine implementation,
#         not because the older behavior is desirable.
#
#         This corresponds to CSS line-break=strict (BCP47 -u-lb-strict).
#         It sets characters of class CJ to behave like NS.

#
#  Character Classes defined by TR 14.
