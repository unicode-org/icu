# Reference Line Break rules for intltest rbbi/RBBIMonkeyTest
#
# Note: Rule syntax and the monkey test itself are still a work in progress.
#       They are expected to change with review and the addition of support for rule tailoring.
#
#         Line Breaking Rules
#         Implement default line breaking as defined by 
#         Unicode Standard Annex #14 Revision 34 for Unicode 8.0
#         http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/
#         tailored as noted in 2nd paragraph below..
#
#         This tailors the line break behavior to correspond to CSS
#         line-break=loose (BCP47 -u-lb-loose) as defined for Chinese & Japanese.
#         It sets characters of class CJ to behave like ID.
#         In addition, it allows breaks:
#         * before hyphens 2010 & 2013 (both BA) and 301C, 30A0 (both NS)
#         * before iteration marks 3005, 303B, 309D, 309E, 30FD, 30FE (all NS)
#         * between characters of LineBreak class IN such as 2026
#         * before some centered punct 203C, 2047, 2048, 2049, 30FB, FF1A, FF1B,
#           FF65 (all NS) and FF01, FF1F (both EX).
#         * before suffix characters with LineBreak class PO and EastAsianWidth A,F,W;
#           this includes: 00B0 2030 2032 2033 2035 2103 2109 FE6A FF05 FFE0
#         * after prefix characters with LineBreak class PR and EastAsianWidth A,F,W;
#           this includes: 00A4 00B1 20AC 2116 FE69 FF04 FFE1 FFE5 FFE6
