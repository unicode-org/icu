    <h3>License Change</h3>
    <p>The ICU projects (ICU4C and ICU4J) have changed their licenses from
    the IPL (IBM Public License) to the X license.
    The X license is a non-viral and recommended free software license that is
    compatible with the GNU GPL license.
    This is effective starting with release 1.8.1 of ICU4C and release 1.3.1 of ICU4J.
    All previous ICU releases will continue to utilize the IPL.
    New ICU releases will adopt the X license.
    The users of previous releases of ICU will need to accept the terms and conditions of
    the X license in order to adopt the new ICU releases.</p>

    <p>The main effect of the change is to provide GPL compatibility.
    The X license is listed as GPL compatible,
    see the gnu page at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses</a>.</p>

    <p>The text of the X license is available at <a href="http://www.x.org/terms.htm">http://www.x.org/terms.htm</a>.
    The IBM version contains the essential text of the license, omitting the X-specific trademarks and copyright notices.</p>

    <p>For more details please see
    the <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/press.html">press announcement</a>

    <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>Today's software market is a global one in which it is desirable to
    develop and maintain one application that supports a wide variety of
    national languages. International Components for Unicode provides the
    following tools to help you write language independent applications:</p>

    <ul type="disc">
      <li>UnicodeString supporting the Unicode 3.0 standard</li>

      <li>Resource bundles for storing and accessing localized
      information</li>

      <li>Number formatters for converting binary numbers into text strings
      for meaningful display</li>

      <li>Date and time formatters for converting internal time data into
      text strings for meaningful display</li>

      <li>Message formatters for putting together sequences of strings,
      numbers dates and other format to create messages</li>

      <li>Text collation supporting language sensitive comparison of
      strings</li>

      <li>Text boundary analysis for finding characters, word and sentence
      boundaries</li>

      <li>Changing simple data files rather than modifying program code
      easily localizes applications written using these tools</li>

      <li>Over 160 locales supported. Visit the <a href=
      "http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/localeexplorer">
      LocaleExplorer
      (http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/localeexplorer)</a>
      site for a demonstration and a full list of supported locales or see
      the <a href=
      "http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/icu/data/index.txt">index
      file with the supported locales</a>. Also see the <a href=
      "http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/">User Guide</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is possible to support additional locales by adding more locale
    data files, with no code changes.</p>

    <p>Please refer to POSIX programmer's Guide for details on what the ISO
    locale ID means.</p>

    <p>Your comments are important to making this release successful. We are
    committed to fixing any bugs, and will also use your feedback to help
    plan future releases.</p>

    <h2><a name="WhatContain">What the International Components for Unicode
    Contain</a></h2>

    <p>There are two ways to download the ICU releases,</p>

    <ul type="disc">
      <li><strong>Official Release Snapshot:</strong><br>
       If you want to use ICU (as opposed to developing it), you should
      download an official packaged version of the ICU source code.
      These versions are tested more thoroughly than day-to-day development
      builds of the system, and they are packaged in zip and tar files for
      convenient download. These packaged files can be found at <a href=
      "http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/">http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/</a>.<br>

       If packaged snapshot is named <strong>ICUXXXXXX.zip</strong> or
      <strong>ICUXXXXXX.tgz</strong> , XXXXXX is the release version
      number.<br>
       Please unzip this file. It will reconstruct the source directory,
      including anonymous CVS control directories (see below).</li>

      <li><strong>CVS Source Repository:</strong><br>
       If you are interested in developing features, patches, or bug fixes
      for ICU, you should probably be working with the latest version of the
      ICU source code. You will need to check the code out of our CVS
      repository to ensure that you have the most recent version of all of
      the files. There are several ways to do this:</li>

      <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul type="circle">
          <li>WebCVS:<br>
           If you want to browse the code and only make occasional downloads,
          you may want to use WebCVS. It provides a convenient, web-based
          interface for browsing and downloading the latest version of the
          ICU source code and documentation. You can also view each file's
          revision history, display the differences between individual
          revisions, determine which revisions were part of which official
          release, and so on.</li>

          <li>
            WinCVS:<br>
             If you will be doing serious work on ICU, you should probably
            install a CVS client on your own machine so that you can do batch
            operations without going through the WebCVS interface. On
            Windows, we suggest the WinCVS client. The following is the
            example instruction on how to download ICU via WinCVS:

            <ol>
              <li>Install the WinCVS client, which you can download from the
              WinCVS home page.</li>

              <li>In the WinCVS preferences, specify your CVSRoot to be
              ":pserver:anoncvs@oss.software.ibm.com:/usr/cvs/icu"<br>
               with the password "anoncvs". To enter the CVSRoot value,
              select "Preferences" from the "Cvs Admin" pull-down menu.
              Authentication should be set to "'passwd' file on the cvs
              server".</li>

              <li>To "extract" the most recent version of ICU, select
              "Checkout module" from the "Cvs Admin" menu. Specify "icu" for
              the module name.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>CVS command line:<br>
           You can also check out the repository anonymously on UNIX using
          the following commands, after first setting your CVSROOT to point
          to the ICU repository:<br>
          <br>
           <i>export
          CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@oss.software.ibm.com:/usr/cvs/icu<br>
           cvs login CVS password: anoncvs<br>
           cvs checkout icu<br>
           cvs logout</i></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>For more details on how to download ICU directly from the web site,
    please also see <a href=
    "http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/">http:/oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/</a></p>

    <p>Below, <strong>$Root</strong> is the placement of the icu directory in
    your file system, like "drive:\...\icu" in your environment. "drive:\..."
    stands for any drive and any directory on that drive that you chose to
    install icu into.</p>

                <li>Release\icui18n.dll -> icuin17.dll</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Also, ctestfw and ex toolutil (now icutu17) libraries appeared in
    icu\bin and icu\lib dirs, but this shouldn't concern regular users of
    ICU.</p>

    <h4>What to do, and how to cope?</h4>

    <p>When you first try to compile your programs with new version of icu,
    compilation will fail. The following steps are required:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Change your path from ...\icu\bin\debug or ...\icu\bin\release to
      just ...\icu\bin</li>

      <li>Make the same change for MSVC executable directory setting
      (tools-&gt;options-&gt;directories)</li>

      <li>In all your .dsp files (project settings), on linker tab change
      input libraries according to the above scheme. You want to do it for
      both debug and release versions.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When a new, binary incompatible version appears after 1.7, the
    libraries will change the version number. Make sure that you reference
    the correct version independent *.lib file when you have more than one
    version of ICU built on your machine. Each *.lib file references its
    correct version dependent shared library. The libraries with debug
    information contain a "d" on the end of the base DLL name (e.g. icuuc.lib
    vs. icuucd.lib).</p>

    <hr>

    <p>If you are building on the Win32 platform, it is important that you
    understand a few build details:</p>

    <p><u>DLL directories and the PATH setting:</u> As delivered, the
    International Components for Unicode build as several DLLs. These DLLs
    are placed in the "icu\bin" directory. You must add this directory to the
    PATH environment variable in your system, or any executables you build
    will not be able to access International Components for Unicode
    libraries. Alternatively, you can copy the DLL files into a directory
    already in your PATH, but we do not recommend this. You can wind up with
    multiple copies of the DLL and wind up using the wrong one.</p>

    <p><u>To change your PATH:</u></p>

    <ul type="disk">
      <li><strong>Windows 2000</strong>: Use the System Icon in the Control
      Panel. Pick the "Advanced" tab. Select the "Environment Variables..."
      button. Select the variable PATH in the lower box, and select the lower
      "Edit..." button. In the "Variable Value" box, append the string
      ";$Root\bin" to the end of the path string. If there is nothing there,
      just type in "$Root\bin". Click the Set button, then the OK
      button.</li>

      <li><strong>Windows NT</strong>: Use the System Icon in the Control
      Panel. Pick the "Environment" tab, and select the variable PATH in the
      lower box. In the "value" box, append the string ";$Root\bin" at the
      end of the path string. If there is nothing there, just type in
      "$Root\bin". Click the Set button, then the OK button.</li>

      <li><strong>Windows 95/98/ME</strong>: Edit the autoexec.bat, and add
      the following line to the end of file, "SET PATH=%PATH%;$Root\bin"</li>
    </ul>

    <p><u>Link with Runtime libraries:</u> All the DLLs link with the C
    runtime library "Debug Multithreaded DLL" or "Multithreaded DLL." (This
    is changed through the Project Settings dialog, on the C/C++ tab, under
    Code Generation.) It is important that any executable or other DLL you
    build which uses the International Components for Unicode DLLs links with
    these runtime libraries as well. If you do not do this, you will
    seemingly get memory errors when you run the executable.<br>
    </p>

    <h3><a name="collation">Collation Improvements</a></h3>
    <p>The collation framework has been reimplemented to make it faster,
    Unicode Collation Algorithm compliant,
    and to make the locale-specific collation data smaller
    (by separating it from the shared UCA data).<br>
    <em>Sort keys and even some collation results have changed from ICU 1.6
    and ICU 1.7.</em><br>
    For details, see our <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/develop/collation/">collation design document</a>.</p>

    <h3><a name="API_documentation">API documentation</a></h3>

    <p>We are updating our API documentation, generated JavaDoc-style from
    the public header files. It is available for <a href=
    "http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/apiref/">online browsing</a> as well as
    <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/download/">for download from the

    <p>Also, as a more general and comprehensive documentation, we are

    <h3><a name="ImportantNotesOS390">OS/390 Platform</a></h3>

    <p>If you are building on the OS/390 UNIX System Services platform, it is
    important that you understand a few details:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The gnu utilities gmake and gzip/gunzip are needed and can be
      obtained for OS/390 from <a href=
      "http://www.mks.com/">http://www.mks.com/</a>. Search for OS/390,
      register, and follow download directions.</li>

      <li>
        Encoding considerations: The source code assumes that it is compiled
        with codepage ibm-1047 (to be exact, the UNIX System Services variant
        of it). The pax command converts all of the source code files from
        ASCII to codepage ibm-1047 (USS) EBCDIC. However, some files are
        binary files and must not be converted, or must be converted back to
        their original state. Those files are:

        <ul>
          <li>All the .brk files located in the icu/data directory
          (icu/data/*.brk)</li>

          <li>icu/source/test/testdata/uni-text.txt</li>

          <li>icu/source/test/testdata/th18057.txt</li>
        </ul>
        Such a conversion can be done using iconv:<br>
         <code>iconv -f IBM-1047 -t ISO8859-1 uni-text.txt &gt;
        uni-text.txt</code>
      </li>

      <li>
        DLL directories and the LIBPATH setting: Building and testing ICU
        needs the ICU libraries on the LIBPATH. In other words, the LIBPATH
        should contain (each path prepended with the root directory that
        contains the icu directory):

        <ul>
          <li>icu/source/common</li>
          <li>icu/source/i18n</li>
          <li>icu/source/tools/ctestfw</li>
          <li>icu/source/tools/toolutil</li>
          <li>icu/source/extra/ustdio</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>OS/390 supports both native S/390 hexadecimal floating point and,
        (with Version 2.6 and later) IEEE binary floating point. This is a
        compile time option. Applications built with IEEE should use ICU dlls
        that are built with IEEE (and vice versa). The environment variable
        IEEE390=1 will cause the OS/390 version of ICU to be built with IEEE
        floating point. The default is native hexadecimal floating point.<br>
         <em>Important:</em> Currently (ICU 1.4.2), native floating point
        support is sufficient for codepage conversion, resource bundle and
        UnicodeString operations, but the Format APIs, especially
        ChoiceFormat, require IEEE binary floating point.</p>

        <p>Examples for configuring ICU:<br>
         Debug build: <code>IEEE390=1 ./configure</code><br>
         Release build: <code>CFLAGS=-2 IEEE390=1 ./configure</code></p>
      </li>

      <li>Since the default make on OS/390 is not gmake, pkgdata tool
      requires that the environment variable MAKE be set to fully
      qualified path to gmake.</li>

      <li>The makedep executable that is used with the OS/390 ICU build
      process is not shipped with ICU. It is available at the <a href=
      "http://www.s390.ibm.com/products/oe/bpxa1ty2.html">OS/390 UNIX - Tools
      and Toys</a> site. The PATH environment variable should be updated to
      contain the location of this executable prior to build. Alternatively,
      makedep may be moved into an existing PATH directory.</li>

      <li>To run all of the tests for ICU, use "gmake check". When running
      individual tests of the test suite, the TZ environment
      variable should be set to export TZ="PST8PDT" so that time zone
      comparisons are correct.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><a name="ImportantNotesOS390Batch">OS/390 Batch (PDS)
    support</a></h4>

    <p>By default, ICU builds its libraries into the HFS. However, there is a
    390-specific switch to build some libraries into PDS files. The switch is
    the environmental variable OS390BATCH, and if set, the following
    libraries are built into PDS files: libicuuc<i>XX</i>.dll,
    libicudt<i>XX</i>e.dll, libicudt<i>XX</i>e_390.dll, and libtestdata.dll.
    Turning on OS390BATCH does not turn off the normal HFS build, thus the
    HFS dlls will always be created.</p>

    <p>The names of the PDS files are determined by the value of the
    environmental variables LOADMOD and LOADEXP. These variables must contain
    the target PDS names whenever the OS390BATCH variable is set. LOADMOD is
    the library (.dll) target dataset and LOADEXP is the side deck (.x)
    target dataset.</p>

    <p>The PDS member names are as follows:</p>
<pre>
IXMICUUC --&gt; libicuuc<i>XX</i>.dll
IXMICUDA --&gt; libicudt<i>XX</i>e.dll
IXMICUD1 --&gt; libicudt<i>XX</i>e_390.dll
IXMICUTE --&gt; libtestdata.dll
</pre>

    <h2><a name="HowToInstall">How To Build And Install ICU</a></h2>

    <h3><a name="HowToInstallWindows">How To Build And Install On
    Windows</a></h3>

    <p>Building International Components for Unicode requires:</p>

    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Microsoft NT 3.51 or above</li>

      <li>Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (Service Pack 2 is required to work with
      the release build of max speed optimization).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The steps are:</p>

    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>Unzip the icu-XXXX.zip file, type "unzip -a icu-XXXX.zip -d
      drive:\directory" under command prompt or use WinZip.
      drive:\directory\icu is the root ($Root) directory (you may but don't
      need to place "icu" into another directory). If you change the root,
      you will change the project settings accordingly in EACH makefile in
      the project, updating the "include" and "library" paths.</li>

      <li>Set the environment variable <strong>ICU_DATA</strong> to the full
      pathname of the data directory. The trailing "\" is required after the
      directory name (e.g. "$Root\source\data\" will work, but the value
      "$Root\source\data" is not acceptable). This environment variable
      indicates where the locale data files and conversion mapping tables are
      located.</li>

      <li>Be sure that the ICU binary directory, $Root\bin\,
      is included in the <strong>PATH</strong> environment variable. The
      tests may not work without the DLL files in the path.</li>

      <li>Set the <strong>TZ</strong> environment variable to
      <strong>PST8PDT</strong>. The tests will not work in any other
      timezone.</li>

      <li>Use Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 to open the
      "$Root\source\allinone\allinone.dsw" workspace (This workspace includes
      all the International Components for Unicode libraries, necessary ICU
      building tools, and the intltest and cintltest test suite
      projects).</li>

      <li>Set the active Project to the "all" project. To do this: Choose
      "Project" menu, and select "Set active project". In the submenu, select
      the "all" workspace.</li>

      <li>Set the active configuration to "Win32 Debug" or "Win32 Release"
      (See note below).</li>

      <li>Choose the "Build" menu and select "Rebuild All". If you want to
      build the Debug and Release configurations at the same time, choose
      "Build" menu and select "Batch Build..." instead (and mark all
      configurations as checked), then click the button named "Rebuild All".
      The "all" workspace will build all the test programs as well as the
      tools for generating binary locale data files. The "makedata" project
      will be run automatically to convert the locale data files from text
      format into icudata.dll.</li>

      <li>Run the C++ test suite, "intltest". To do this: set the active
      project to "intltest", and press F5 to run it.</li>

      <li>Run the C test suite, "cintltst". To do this: set the active
      project to "cintltst", and press F5 to run it.</li>

      <li>Make sure that both "cintltst" and "intltest" passed without any
      errors. The return codes are non-zero when they do not pass. Visual C++
      will display the return codes in the debug tag of the output window.
      When "intltest" and "cintltest" return 0, it means that everything is
      installed correctly.</li>

      <li>Reset the <strong>TZ</strong> environment variable to its original
      value, unless you plan on testing ICU any further.</li>

      <li>You are now able to develop applications with ICU.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> To set the active configuration, two different
    possibilities are:</p>

    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Choose "Build" menu, select "Set Active Configuration", and select
      "Win32 Release" or "Win32 Debug".</li>

      <li>Another way is to select "Customize" in the "Tools" menu, select
      the "Toolbars" tab, enable "Build" instead of "Build Minibar", and
      click on "Close". This will bring up a toolbar which you can move aside
      the other permanent toolbars at the top of the MSVC window. The
      advantage is that you now have an easy-to-reach pop-up menu that will
      always show the currently selected active configuration. Or, you can
      drag the project and configuration selections and drop them on the menu
      bar for later selection.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is also possible to build each library individually, using the
    workspaces in each respective directory. They have to be built in the
    following order:<br>
    </p>

    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>common</li>

      <li>i18n</li>

      <li>makedata (which invokes makeconv, genrb, genccode, etc.)</li>

      <li>ctestfw</li>

      <li>intltest and cintltst, if you want to run the test suite.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="HowToInstallUnix">How To Build And Install On Unix</a></h3>

    <p>There is a set of Makefiles for Unix that supports Linux w/gcc,
    Solaris w/gcc and Workshop CC, AIX w/xlc and OS/390 with C++.</p>

    <p>Building International Components for Unicode on Unix requires:</p>

    <p>A UNIX C++ compiler, (gcc, cc, xlc_r, etc...) installed on the target
    machine. A recent version of GNU make (3.7+). OS/390 gnu utilities for
    both make (gmake) and zip (gzip/gunzip) can be found at the MKS web site
    at <a href="http://www.mks.com">http://www.mks.com</a>. Please do a
    search on "os/390".</p>

    <p>The steps are:</p>

    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>Decompress the icuXXXX.tar (or icuXXXX.tgz) file and use pax.</li>

      <li>Before running the test programs or samples, please set the
      environment variable <strong>ICU_DATA</strong>, the full pathname of
      the data directory, to indicate where the locale data files and
      conversion mapping tables are. If this variable is not set, the default
      user data directory will be used. The trailing "/" is required after
      the directory name (e.g. "$Root/source/data/" will work, but the value
      "$Root/source/data" is not acceptable). When you are running individual
      tests, the <strong>TZ</strong> environment variable needs to be set to
      <strong>PST8PDT</strong>. Normally "make check" does this for you
      automatically.</li>

      <li>Change directory to the "icu/source".</li>

      <li>If it is not already set, please set the executable flag for the
      following files (by executing 'chmod +x' command): runConfigureICU,
      configure, install-sh and config.*,</li>

      <li>You also need to set other environment variables for different
      build systems. See the <a href=
      "http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/">User Guide</a> or the
      provided <a href="source/runConfigureICU">script</a>.</li>

      <li>Type "./configure" or type "./configure --help" to print the
      available options.</li>

      <li>Type "make" to compile the libraries and all the data files. On
      OS/390, both IEEE binary floating point and native S/390 hexadecimal
      floating point calculations are supported. The default is to build with
      native floating-point support. Please set the environment variable
      IEEE390=1 if you would like to make the ICU DLLs with IEEE floating
      point support.</li>

      <li>Optionally, type "make check" to verify the test suite.</li>

      <li>Type "make install" to install.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Some platforms use package management tools to control the
    installation and uninstallation of files on the system, as well as the
    integrity of the system configuration. You may want to check if ICU can
    be packaged for your package management tools by looking into the
    "packaging" directory. (Please note that if you are using a snapshot of
    ICU from CVS, it is probable that the packaging scripts or related files
    are not up to date with the contents of ICU at this time, so use them
    with caution.)</p>

    <p>It is also possible to build each library individually, using the
    Makefiles in each respective directory. They have to be built in the
    following order:</p>

    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>common</li>

      <li>i18n</li>

      <li>makeconv</li>

      <li>genrb</li>

      <li>gentz</li>

      <li>genccode</li>

      <li>ctestfw</li>

      <li>intltest and cintltst, if you want to run the test suite.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="sharedLibNote">Using Shared Data Libraries</a></h3>

    <p>HP/UX has a documented characteristic where the shl_unload() function
    always unloads a library, regardless of how many times the library has
    been loaded. Most operating systems reference count libraries as they are
    opened. In the future (Jitterbug 414) this may be corrected in ICU, but
    at present, we work around this problem by simply NOT ever unloading
    shared libraries. This means that once a data library is loaded (ex:
    libicudata.sl) by a process, it cannot be unloaded and replaced without
    stopping and restarting the process.</p>


    <h3><a name="ErrcodeChanges">Important Change Of Error Codes From
    Streaming Conversion Functions (change for ICU 1.6)</a></h3>

    <p>We have decided to make a semantic change to the conversion API which
    affects applications using ICU that are migrated to use ICU versions 1.6
    or later compared to earlier ICU versions before 1.6:<br>
     The error code that is set from streaming conversion like</p>
<pre>
ucnv_fromUnicode() - ucnv_toUnicode()
ucnv_fromUChars()  - ucnv_toUChars()
scsu_compress()    - scsu_decompress()
</pre>
    when the target buffer is full but the source not empty is changed from
    <code>U_INDEX_OUTOFBOUNDS_ERROR</code> to
    <code>U_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_ERROR</code>. This change makes the error codes
    more consistent with their names and with their use in other icu
    APIs.<br>
     <br>


    <p>You need to test for this new error code if your code uses ICU for
    conversion and used the old error code. ucnv.h and scsu.h are updated
    with this information. Please search in your source code for
    <code>U_INDEX_OUTOFBOUNDS_ERROR</code>. If it is used with the above
    functions (<em>not</em> with <code>ucnv_getNextUChar()</code>), then you
    need to change it to <code>U_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_ERROR</code> in order to get
    your code to work with icu 1.6 or later.</p>

    <p>See the updated sample code in <code>icu/source/samples</code>. All
    samples are updated. See <a href=
    "http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/bugs?findid=516">
    jitterbug 516</a> for details. This was discussed in July 2000 on the icu
    mailing list. Please see the list archive for the <a href=
