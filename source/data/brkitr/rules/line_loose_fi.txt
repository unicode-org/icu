#         Line Breaking Rules
#         Implement default line breaking as defined by
#         Unicode Standard Annex #14 Revision 35 for Unicode 8.0
#         http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/
#         tailored as noted in 2nd paragraph below.
#
#         Includes the Emoji breaking proposals from Unicode L2/16-011R3.

#
#         tailored as noted in 2nd paragraph below.
#
#         TODO:  Rule LB 8 remains as it was in Unicode 5.2
#         This is only because of a limitation of ICU break engine implementation,
#         not because the older behavior is desirable.
#
#         This tailors the line break behavior both for Finnish and to correpond to CSS
#         line-break=loose (BCP47 -u-lb-loose) as defined for languages other than
#         Chinese & Japanese.
#         It sets characters of class CJ to behave like ID.
#         In addition, it allows breaks before 3005, 303B, 309D, 309E, 30FD, 30FE (all NS).
