# This file contains the list of directories in the file system that ICUTZU will
# use to search for updatable icu4j jar files. It must be saved in UTF-8 (with
# or without the BOM).
#
# To include all roots of the file system (ie. 'c:\', 'd:\', 'e:\', etc. in Windows
# or '/' in Unix-based systems), insert the following:
#   all
#
# To include a directory in the search or to directly include a specific icu4j file,
# insert the directory in the native format with a leading '+'. For example in Windows:
#   +C:\ICU4J
#   +C:\ICU4J\icu4j.jar
# Or in Unix-based systems:
#   +/usr/icu4j
#   +/usr/icu4j/icu4j.jar
#
# To exclude a directory or file from the search, do the same as above but with a
# leading '-' instead:
#   -C:\ICU4J
#   -/usr/icu4j

all

# If you are not using a Unix-based platform, the following lines should be removed:

-/proc
-/dev
-/sys
