# Security Policy

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it
privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you
to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be
used before a patch is released.

Please submit the bug report as an [ICU Jira issue](https://icu.unicode.org/bugs).
Be sure to set "Security level: Sensitive".
This ensures the report will only be visible to the ICU team.

Please provide the following information in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact
- How to reproduce the issue

This project is maintained by volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As such, we ask
that you give us 90 days to work on a fix before public exposure.
