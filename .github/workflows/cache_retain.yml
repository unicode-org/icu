# This workflow is designed to keep specific caches on the main
# branch from getting evicted according to the Github Actions policy
# (currently in 2023: 7 days) in cases where the cost to construct
# the cache is high, especially in cases where there is flakiness
# (ex: network loss / throttling when downloading artifacts) involved in
# constructing the cache.
#
# Preventing a cache from eviction using this workflow requires that:
#  - the cache is not too big that it starves other caches 
#    from using the shared cache quota for the repository
#  - the cache key is specific enough to avoid cache collisions, according
#    to good cache key design
#  - the cache key is not overly specific to cause unnecessary cache misses
#    (resulting in duplicate caches values, thereby wasting space), according
#    to good cache key design
#  - For more details, see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows
