# Note: the workflow here is based on the Github Actions workflow used
# by the Jekyll theme we are using:
# https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml
#
# The Jekyll theme (just-the-docs) configured its Github CI to manually run the Jekyll
# build instead of relying on the default behavior from
# https://github.com/actions/jekyll-build-pages . The default behavior of 
# actions/jekyll-build-pages seems to be causing errors with this theme.
