# GitHub Actions workflow to ensure all required checks pass when they are attempted.
# In other words, many checks are conditionally run, so use this workflow as a workaround
# to a limitation in Github Actions in how required checks are enforced. Instead of 
# Github's naive behavior currently, this workflow only asserts that status=passing on
# checks when they are run.
