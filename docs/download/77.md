# ICU 77

ICU is the [premier library for software internationalization](https://icu.unicode.org/#h.i33fakvpjb7o),
used by a [wide array of companies and organizations](https://icu.unicode.org/#h.f9qwubthqabj).

## Not released yet!

**ICU 77 is still under development.
Once we have a release candidate, use it for testing, but do not use it in production!**

## Release Overview

* TODO -- below is old

ICU 77 updates to
[CLDR 47](https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-47)
(TODO: blog)
locale data with new locales, and various additions and corrections.

TODO: Highlights

The Java technology preview implementation of the CLDR MessageFormat 2.0 specification has been updated to match the
[CLDR 46.1 spec](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-74/tr35-messageFormat.html).

The C++ technology preview implementation of MessageFormat 2.0 is not yet quite up to date with CLDR 46.1.

For more details, including migration issues, see below.

Please use the [icu-support mailing list](https://icu.unicode.org/contacts) and/or [find/submit error reports](https://icu.unicode.org/bugs).

### Version Number

The initial release has library version number 77.1.

* Release date: 2025-03-TODO
  * [List of tickets fixed in ICU 77](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ICU%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Done%20AND%20resolution%20in%20%28Fixed%2C%20%22Fixed%20by%20Other%20Ticket%22%29%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%2077.1%20ORDER%20BY%20component%20ASC%2C%20created%20DESC)

If there are maintenance releases, they will be 77.2, 77.3, etc. (During ICU 77 development, the library version number was 77.0.x.)

Note: There may be additional commits on the [maint/maint-77](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/tree/maint/maint-77) branch that are not included in the prepackaged download files.

## Common Changes

* [CLDR 47](https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-47)
  (TODO: blog):
  * No major data collection for existing locales; focus on bug fixes and structural improvements
  * New regional variants: English in several European countries, and Cantonese in Macau (`yue_Hant_MO`)
  * Improved RBNF (number spellout) and transliteration data
* Subtle segmentation changes to make ICU fully conform to Unicode 16
  * Word break: Root tailoring of colon reverted, Swedish & Finnish tailorings removed
    ([ICU-22941](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22941))
    * These tailorings were introduced in ICU 72, but feedback has been negative,
      and the UTC declined to adopt these changes.
  * Updated Indic grapheme clusters to use the latest `Indic_Conjunct_Break` data
    ([ICU-22956](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22956))
* Time zone data (tzdata) version 2025a (2025-jan).

## ICU4C Specific Changes

* [API changes since ICU4C 76 (Markdown)](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/maint/maint-77/icu4c/APIChangeReport.md) / [(HTML)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/maint/maint-77/icu4c/APIChangeReport.html)
  * New APIs for colloquial C++ use of C USet ([ICU-22876](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22876))
    and C UCollator ([ICU-22879](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22879))
    * These were added in ICU 76, but some of the new APIs did not actually compile with `U_SHOW_CPLUSPLUS_API=0`.
      They have been fixed in ICU 77 and thoroughly tested.
      USetElementIterator now returns std::u16string instead of icu::UnicodeString,
      and therefore it and related APIs have been changed to `@draft ICU 77`.
      ([ICU-22954](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22954))
    * For details about these APIs and an example see the
      ‚ÄúC++ Header-Only APIs‚Äù section of the [ICU 76 Migration Issues](76.md#migration-issues).

## ICU4J Specific Changes

* [API Changes since ICU4J 76](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/maint/maint-77/icu4j/APIChangeReport.html)
* The Java technology preview implementation of the CLDR MessageFormat 2.0 specification has been updated to match the
  [CLDR 46.1 spec](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-74/tr35-messageFormat.html).

## Known Issues

* TODO -- below is old
* One late CLDR 46 bug fix was accidentally omitted from ICU 46:
  [CLDR-18002](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-18002) Fix likely subtag inconsistency
  ([CLDR PR #4105](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/pull/4105))

## Migration Issues

* TODO -- below is old

### C++ Header-Only APIs
ICU 76 is the first version where we add what we call C++ header-only APIs.
These are especially intended for users who rely on only binary stable DLL/library exports of C APIs
(C++ APIs cannot be binary stable).

_Please test these new APIs and let us know if you find problems ‚Äî
especially if you find a platform/compiler/options combination
where the call site does end up calling into ICU DLL/library exports._

Remember that regular C++ APIs can be hidden by callers defining `U_SHOW_CPLUSPLUS_API=0`.
The new header-only APIs can be separately enabled via `U_SHOW_CPLUSPLUS_HEADER_API=1`.

([GitHub query for `U_SHOW_CPLUSPLUS_HEADER_API` in public header files](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aunicode-org%2Ficu+U_SHOW_CPLUSPLUS_HEADER_API+path%3Aunicode%2F*.h&type=code))

These are C++ definitions that are not exported by the ICU DLLs/libraries,
are thus inlined into the calling code,
and which may call ICU C APIs but not into ICU non-header-only C++ APIs.

The header-only APIs are defined in a nested `header` namespace.
If entry point renaming is turned off (the main namespace is `icu` rather than `icu_76` etc.),
then the new `U_HEADER_ONLY_NAMESPACE` is `icu::header`.

([Link to the API proposal which introduced this concept](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xERVccTYsptzjfbjcj6HDtoKVF_mEKmslPsOiQzzaFg/view#heading=h.cf4bmhjgozry))

For example, for iterating over the code point ranges in a `USet` (excluding the strings):

```c++
U_NAMESPACE_USE
using U_HEADER_NESTED_NAMESPACE::USetRanges;
LocalUSetPointer uset(uset_openPattern(u"[abc√ß„Ç´üö¥]", -1, &errorCode));
for (auto [start, end] : USetRanges(uset.getAlias())) {
    printf("uset.range U+%04lx..U+%04lx\n", (long)start, (long)end);
}
for (auto range : USetRanges(uset.getAlias())) {
    for (UChar32 c : range) {
        printf("uset.range.c U+%04lx\n", (long)c);
    }
}
```

(Implementation note: On most platforms, when compiling ICU itself,
the `U_HEADER_ONLY_NAMESPACE` is `icu::internal`,
so that any such symbols that get exported differ from the ones that calling code sees.
On Windows, where DLL exports are explicit,
the namespace is always the same, but these header-only APIs are not marked for export.)

### Migration Issues Related to CLDR
* See [CLDR 47 migration issues](https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-47#migration)

## ICU4C Platform Support

ICU4C requires C++17 and has been tested with up to C++20.

We routinely test on recent versions of Linux, macOS, and Windows.

We accept patches for other platforms.

Windows: The minimum supported version is Windows 7. (See [How To Build And Install On Windows](../userguide/icu4c/build.html#how-to-build-and-install-on-windows) for more details.)

## ICU4J Platform Support

ICU4J works on Java 8..21 (at least).

ICU4J should work on Android API level 21 and later but may require ‚Äú[library desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring)‚Äù.

## Download
