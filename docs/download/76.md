# ICU 76

ICU is the [premier library for software internationalization](https://icu.unicode.org/#h.i33fakvpjb7o), used by a [wide array of companies and organizations](https://icu.unicode.org/#h.f9qwubthqabj).

## Release Overview

ICU 76 updates to [Unicode 16](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/) (TODO: link to blog),
including new characters and scripts, emoji, collation & IDNA changes, and corresponding APIs and implementations.
It also updates to [CLDR 46](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/docs/site/downloads/cldr-46.md) (TODO: link to blog) locale data with new locales and various additions and corrections.

There are some new APIs to make ICU easier to use with modern C++ and Java patterns.

The Java and C++ technology preview implementations of the (also in [tech preview](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg?tab=readme-ov-file#messageformat-2-technical-preview)) CLDR MessageFormat 2.0 specification have been updated to match recent changes.

For more details, including migration issues, see below.

Please use the [icu-support mailing list](https://icu.unicode.org/contacts) and/or [find/submit error reports](https://icu.unicode.org/bugs).

  * TODO: new stuff

  * Many changes for more robust string and buffer handling.

## ICU4J Specific Changes

* [API Changes since ICU4J 75](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/maint/maint-76/icu4j/APIChangeReport.html)  
  * TODO: new stuff

## Known Issues

* TODO: new stuff
* TODO: below is from 75
* [ICU-22729](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22729) udatpg_getBestPattern requires exact skeleton match in ICU 76  
  * Due to a combination of an ICU bug fix and issues with CLDR availableFormats data, some skeletons in some languages yield inconsistent data/time formatting patterns.

## Migration Issues

* See [CLDR 46 migration issues](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/docs/site/downloads/cldr-46.md#migration)
  * TODO: new stuff
  * TODO: below is from 75
  * ICU4C behavior for ill-formed locale IDs/language tags: uloc_getName(), uloc_getLanguage() and similar functions (and functions that rely on them) may fail with a U_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT_ERROR when they used to fail only with a U_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_ERROR. (due to changes for [ICU-22520](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22520))  
  * On Linux, the configure script now defaults to "cc" rather than preferring "clang". If you want to choose clang, then configure for "Linux/clang". ([ICU-22556](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22556))

## ICU4C Platform Support

ICU4C requires C++17 and has been tested with up to C++20.

We routinely test on recent versions of Linux, macOS, and Windows.

We accept patches for other platforms.

Windows: The minimum supported version is Windows 7. (See [How To Build And Install On Windows](../userguide/icu4c/build.html#how-to-build-and-install-on-windows) for more details.)

## ICU4J Platform Support

ICU4J works on Java 8..17 (at least).

ICU4J should work on Android API level 21 and later but may require “[library desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring)”.
