# ICU Documentation

[![ICU logo](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu-docs/raw/master/img/iculogo_64.png)](http://site.icu-project.org/)

## ICU User Guide

The [ICU User Guide](./userguide) provides information on i18n topics for which ICU has services, and
includes details that go beyond the C, C++, and Java API docs (and avoids some duplication between them).

This is the new home of the User Guide (since 2020 August).

## ICU team member pages

Other documentation pages here are written by and for team members.
