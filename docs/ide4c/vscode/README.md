# Configuring VS Code for ICU4C

  - Create a `.vscode` folder in icu4c/source
  - Copy the `tasks.json`, `launch.json` and `c_cpp_properties.json` files into
    the `.vscode` folder.
  - To test only specific test targets, specify them under `args` in
    `launch.json`.
  - To adjust the parallelism when building, adjust the `args` in `tasks.json`.
    - `-l20` tells VSCode to not launch jobs if the system load average is above
      20 (note that the [system load
      average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)) is *not* a CPU
      usage percentage).
    - `-j24` limits the number of jobs launched in parallel to 24. The system
      load average takes a while to respond, reducing this number helps the
      initial bad system performance when a new build is launched.

NOTE:
Run the
[`./runConfigureICU` command](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/icufaq)
before building `icu4c` from VSCode.
