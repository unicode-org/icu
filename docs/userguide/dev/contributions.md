## Why Contribute?

ICU is an open source library that is a de-facto industry standard for
internationalization libraries. Our goal is to provide top of the line i18n
support on all widely used platforms. By contributing your code to the ICU
library, you will get the benefit of continuing improvement by the ICU team and
the community, as well as testing and multi-platform portability. In addition,
it saves you from having to re-merge your own additions into ICU each time you
upgrade to a new ICU release.

## Current Process
