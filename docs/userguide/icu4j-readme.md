## Introduction to ICU4J

The International Components for Unicode (ICU) library provides robust and full-featured Unicode services on a wide variety of platforms. ICU supports the most current version of the Unicode standard, including support for supplementary characters (needed for GB 18030 repertoire support).

Java provides a strong foundation for global programs, and IBM and the ICU team played a key role in providing globalization technology to Java. But because of its long release schedule, Java cannot always keep up with evolving standards. The ICU team continues to extend Java's Unicode and internationalization support, focusing on improving performance, keeping current with the Unicode standard, and providing richer APIs, while remaining as compatible as possible with the original Java text and internationalization API design.

ICU4J is an add-on to the regular JRE that provides:

*   [Collation](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/collation) – rule-based, up-to-date Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) sorting order
        For fast multilingual string comparison; faster and more complete than the J2SE implementation
*   [Charset Detection](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/conversion/detection) – Recognition of various single and multibyte charsets
        Useful for recognizing untagged text data
*   [UnicodeSet](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/strings/unicodeset) – standard set operations optimized for sets of Unicode characters
        UnicodeSets can be built from string patterns using any Unicode properties.
*   [Transforms](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/transforms) – a flexible mechanism for Unicode text conversions
        Including Full/Halfwidth conversions, Normalization, Case conversions, Hex conversions, and transliterations between scripts (50+ pairs)
*   [Unicode Normalization](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/transforms/normalization) – NFC, NFD, NFKD, NFKC
        For canonical text representations, needed for XML and the net
*   [International Calendars](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/datetime/calendar) – Arabic, Buddhist, Chinese, Hebrew, Japanese, Ethiopic, Islamic, Coptic and other calendars
        Required for correct presentation of dates in certain countries
*   [Date Format Enhancements](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/format_parse/datetime) – Date/time pattern generator, Relative date formatting, etc.
        Enhancements to the normal Java date formatting.
*   [Number Format Enhancements](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/format_parse/numbers) – Scientific Notation, Spelled-out, Compact decimal format, etc.
        Enhancements to the normal Java number formatting. The spell-out format is used for checks and similar documents
*   [Enhanced Word-Break Detection](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/boundaryanalysis) – Rule-based, supports Thai, Khmer, Chinese, etc.
        Required for correct support of Thai
*   [Unicode Text Compression](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/conversion/compression) – Standard compression of Unicode text
        Suitable for large numbers of small fields, where LZW and similar schemes do not apply
*   [Charset Conversion](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/conversion) – Conversion to and from different charsets.
        Plugs into Java CharsetProvider Service Provider Interface (SPI)

> :point_right: **Note:** We continue to provide assistance to Java, and in some cases, ICU4J support has been rolled into a later release of Java. For example, BCP47 language tag support including Unicode locale extensions is now in Java 7\. However, the most current and complete version is always found in ICU4J.

## What Is New In The Current Release?

See the [ICU download page](http://site.icu-project.org/download/) to find the subpage for the current release, including any other changes, bug fixes, known issues, changes to supported platforms and build environments, and migration issues for existing applications migrating from previous ICU releases.

The subpage for the current release will also include an API Change Report, both for ICU4C and ICU4J, for a complete list of APIs added, removed, or changed in this release.

The list of API changes since the previous ICU4J release is available [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unicode-org/icu/master/icu4j/APIChangeReport.html).

Changes in previous releases can also be found the main [ICU download page](http://site.icu-project.org/download) in its version-specific subpages.

## License Information

The ICU projects (ICU4C and ICU4J) are hosted by the [Unicode Consortium](http://www.unicode.org/). The ICU binary and source files are distributed under the [UNICODE DATA FILES AND SOFTWARE LICENSE](http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html). The full copy of the license and third party software licenses are available in [LICENSE](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/master/icu4j/main/shared/licenses/LICENSE) file included in this package.

## Platform Dependencies

The minimum Java runtime version supported by ICU4J 68 is version 7\. Java runtime version 6 is not supported.

ICU4J since version 63 depend on J2SE 7 functionality. Therefore, ICU4J only runs on JRE version 7 or later. ICU4J 68 is tested on JRE 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.

## How to Download ICU4J

There are a few different ways to download the ICU4J releases.

*   **Official Release:**
    If you want to use ICU4J (as opposed to developing it), your best bet is to download an official, packaged version of the ICU4J library files. These versions are tested more thoroughly than day-to-day development builds, and they are packaged in jar files for convenient download.

*   **GitHub Source Repository:**
    If you are interested in developing features, patches, or bug fixes for ICU4J, you should probably be working with the latest version of the ICU4J source code. You will need to clone and checkout the code from our GitHub repository to ensure that you have the most recent version of all of the files. There are several ways to do this. Please follow the directions that are contained on the [Source Repository page](http://www.icu-project.org/repository/) for details.

## How to Install and Build

To install ICU4J, simply place the pre-built jar file `icu4j.jar` on your Java `CLASSPATH`. If you need Charset API support please also place `icu4j-charset.jar` on your class path along with `icu4j.jar`.

To build ICU4J, you will need JDK 7 or later (JDK 8 is the reference environment for this release) and the Apache Ant version 1.9 or later. It's recommended to install both the JDK and Ant somewhere _outside_the ICU4J directory. For example, on Linux you might install these in `/usr/local`.

*   Install JDK 8.
*   Install the [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) 1.9 or later.
*   Set environment variables `JAVA_HOME`, `ANT_HOME` and `PATH`, for example:

~~~
set JAVA_HOME=C:\jdk1.8.0
set ANT_HOME=C:\apache-ant
set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%ANT_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
~~~

Once the JDK and Ant are configured, run the desired target defined in `build.xml`. The default target is `jar` which compiles ICU4J library class files and create ICU4J jar files. For example:

~~~
C:\icu4j>ant
Buildfile: C:\icu4j\build.xml

## Trying Out ICU4J

> :point_right: **Note**: the demos provided with ICU4J are for the most part undocumented. This list can show you where to look, but you'll have to experiment a bit. The demos are **unsupported** and may change or disappear without notice.

The icu4j.jar file contains only the ICU4J runtime library classes, not the demo classes, so unless you build ICU4J there is little to try out.

### Charset

To try out the **Charset** package, build **icu4j.jar** and **icu4j-charset.jar** using the `jar` target. You can use the charsets by placing these files on your classpath.

~~~
java -cp $icu4j_root/icu4j.jar:$icu4j_root/icu4j-charset.jar <your program>
~~~

### Other demos

The other demo programs are **not supported** and exist only to let you experiment with the ICU4J classes. First, build ICU4J using `ant jarDemos`. Then launch the demos as below:

~~~
java -jar $icu4j_root/icu4jdemos.jar
~~~

## ICU4J Resource Information

Starting with release 2.1, ICU4J includes its own resource information which is completely independent of the JRE resource information. (Note, ICU4J 2.8 to 3.4, time zone information depends on the underlying JRE). The ICU4J resource information is equivalent to the information in ICU4C and many resources are, in fact, the same binary files that ICU4C uses.

By default the ICU4J distribution includes all of the standard resource information. It is located under the directory com/ibm/icu/impl/data. Depending on the service, the data is in different locations and in different formats.

> :point_right: **Note**: This will continue to change from release to release, so clients should not depend on the exact organization of the data in ICU4J.

*   The primary **locale data** is under the directory `icudt68b`, as a set of `".res"` files whose names are the locale identifiers. Locale naming is documented the `com.ibm.icu.util.ULocale` class, and the use of these names in searching for resources is documented in `com.ibm.icu.util.UResourceBundle`.
*   The **break iterator data** is under the directory `icudt68b/brkitr`, as a set of `".res"`, `".brk"` and `".dict"` files.
*   The **collation data** is under the directory `icudt68b/coll`, as a set of `".res"` files.
*   The **currency display name data** is under the directory `icudt68b/curr`, as a set of `".res"` files.
*   The **language display name data** is under the directory `icudt68b/lang`, as a set of `".res"` files.
*   The **rule-based number format data** is under the directory `icudt68b/rbnf`, as a set of `".res"` files.
*   The **region display name data** is under the directory `icudt68b/region`, as a set of `".res"` files.
*   The **rule-based transliterator data** is under the directory `icudt68b/translit`, as a set of `".res"` files.
*   The **measurement unit data** is under the directory `icudt68b/unit`, as a set of `".res"` files.
*   The **time zone display name data** is under the directory `icudt68b/zone`, as a set of `".res"` files.
*   The **character property data** and default **unicode collation algorithm (UCA) data** is found under the directory `icudt68b`, as a set of `".icu"` files.
*   The **normalization data** is found under the directory `icudt68b`, as a set of `".nrm"` files.
*   The **character set converter data** is under the directory `icudt68b`, as a set of `".cnv"` files. These files are currently included only in icu-charset.jar.
*   The **time zone rule data** is under the directory `icudt68b`, as `zoneinfo64.res`.
*   The **holiday data** is under the directory `icudt68b`, as a set of `".class"` files, named `"HolidayBundle_"` followed by the locale ID.

Some of the data files alias or otherwise reference data from other data files. One reason for this is because some locale names have changed. For example, `he_IL` used to be `iw_IL`. In order to support both names but not duplicate the data, one of the resource files refers to the other file's data. In other cases, a file may alias a portion of another file's data in order to save space. Currently ICU4J provides no tool for revealing these dependencies.

> :point_right: **Note**: Java's `Locale` class silently converts the language code `"he"` to `"iw"` when you construct the Locale (for versions of Java through Java 5). Thus Java cannot be used to locate resources that use the `"he"` language code. ICU, on the other hand, does not perform this conversion in ULocale, and instead uses aliasing in the locale data to represent the same set of data under different locale ids.

Resource files that use locale ids form a hierarchy, with up to four levels: a root, language, region (country), and variant. Searches for locale data attempt to match as far down the hierarchy as possible, for example, `"he_IL"` will match `he_IL`, but `"he_US"` will match `he` (since there is no `US` variant for he, and `"xx_YY` will match root (the default fallback locale) since there is no `xx` language code in the locale hierarchy. Again, see `java.util.ResourceBundle` for more information.

**Currently ICU4J provides no tool for revealing these dependencies** between data files, so trimming the data directly in the ICU4J project is a hit-or-miss affair. The key point when you remove data is to make sure to remove all dependencies on that data as well. For example, if you remove `he.res`, you need to remove `he_IL.res`, since it is lower in the hierarchy, and you must remove iw.res, since it references `he.res`, and `iw_IL.res`, since it depends on it (and also references `he_IL.res`).

Unfortunately, the jar tool in the JDK provides no way to remove items from a jar file. Thus you have to extract the resources, remove the ones you don't want, and then create a new jar file with the remaining resources. See the jar tool information for how to do this. Before 'rejaring' the files, be sure to thoroughly test your application with the remaining resources, making sure each required resource is present.

### Using additional resource files with ICU4J

> :warning: **Warning: Resource file formats can change across releases of ICU4J!**
>
> The format of ICU4J resources is not part of the API. Clients who develop their own resources for use with ICU4J should be prepared to regenerate them when they move to new releases of ICU4J.


We are still developing ICU4J's resource mechanism. Currently it is not possible to mix icu's new binary `.res` resources with traditional java-style `.class` or `.txt` resources. We might allow for this in a future release, but since the resource data and format is not formally supported, you run the risk of incompatibilities with future releases of ICU4J.

Resource data in ICU4J is checked in to the repository as a jar file containing the resource binaries, `$icu4j_root/main/shared/data/icudata.jar`. This means that inspecting the contents of these resources is difficult. They currently are compiled from ICU4C `.txt` file data. You can view the contents of the ICU4C text resource files to understand the contents of the ICU4J resources.

The files in `icudata.jar` get extracted to `com/ibm/icu/impl/data` in the build output directory by some build targets.

### Building ICU4J Resources from ICU4C

ICU4J data is built by ICU4C tools. Please see [`icu4j-readme.txt`](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/master/icu4c/source/data/icu4j-readme.txt) in `icu4c/source/data` for the procedures.

#### Generating Data from CLDR

> :point_right: **Note**: This procedure assumes that all 3 sources are present

> :point_right: **Note**: The following example was written using the example of the CLDR 38 release which was released in conjunction with the ICU 68.1 release

1.  Checkout or download CLDR version `release-38`
2.  Checkout ICU with tag `release-68-1`
3.  cd to icu4c/source/data directory
4.  Follow the instructions in [`icu4c/source/data/cldr-icu-readme.txt`](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/master/icu4c/source/data/cldr-icu-readme.txt)
5.  Rebuild ICU4C with the newly generated data.
6.  Run ICU4C tests to verify that the new data is good.
7.  Build ICU4J data from ICU4C data by following the procedures in [`icu4j/source/data/icu4j-readme.txt`](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/master/icu4c/source/data/icu4j-readme.txt)
8.  cd to `icu4j` dir
9.  Build and test icu4j

## About ICU4J Time Zone

ICU4J library includes the latest time zone data, as of the release date. However, time zone data is frequently updated in response to changes made by local governments around the world. If you need to update the time zone data, please refer the ICU user guide topic [Updating the Time Zone Data](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/datetime/timezone#updating-the-time-zone-data).

You can optionally configure ICU4J date and time service classes to use underlying JDK TimeZone implementation (see the ICU4J API reference [TimeZone](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/util/TimeZone.html) for the details). When this configuration is enabled, ICU's own time zone data won't be used and you have to get time zone data patches from the JRE vendor.
