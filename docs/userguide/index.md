# ICU User Guide

[![ICU logo](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu-docs/raw/main/img/iculogo_64.png)](https://icu.unicode.org/)

This User Guide provides information on i18n topics for which ICU has services, and
includes details that go beyond the C, C++, and Java API docs (and avoids some duplication between them).

You may want to start with the [Introduction to ICU](./icu) or browse the navigation bar for a specific topic.

This is the new home of the User Guide (since 2020 August).
