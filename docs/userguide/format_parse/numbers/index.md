# Formatting Numbers

Since ICU 60, the recommended mechanism for formatting numbers is 
[`NumberFormatter`](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4c/numberformatter_8h.html)
([Java](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/number/NumberFormatter.html)).  `NumberFormatter` supports the formatting of:

- Decimal Formatting
- Currencies
- Measurement Units
- Percentages
- Scientific Notation
- Compact Notation

For number ranges, including currency and measurement unit ranges, see [`NumberRangeFormatter`](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4c/numberrangeformatter_8h.html) ([Java](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/number/NumberRangeFormatter.html)).

For rule-based number formatting, including spellout rules and support for traditional numbering systems not covered by base-10 decimal digits, see [rbnf.md](rbnf.md).

For the classic `NumberFormat` class, which also includes legacy parsing support for localized number strings, see [legacy-numberformat.md](legacy-numberformat.md).
