# Formatting Dates and Times

## Formatting Dates and Times Overview

Date and time formatters are used to convert dates and times from their internal
representations to textual form and back again in a language-independent manner.
The date and time formatters use `UDate`, which is the internal representation.
Converting from the internal representation (milliseconds since midnight,
January 1, 1970) to text is known as "formatting," and converting from text to
milliseconds is known as "parsing." These processes involve two mappings:

*   A mapping between a point in time (UDate) and a set of calendar fields,
    which in turn depends on:
    *   The rules of a particular calendar system (e.g. Gregorian, Buddhist,
        Chinese Lunar)
    *   The time zone
*   A mapping between a set of calendar fields and a formatted textual
    representation, which depends on the fields selected for display, their
    display style, and the conventions of a particular locale.

## DateFormat

DateFormat helps format and parse dates for any locale. Your code can be
completely independent of the locale conventions for months, days of the week,
or calendar format.

### Formatting Dates

The DateFormat interface in ICU enables you to format a Date in milliseconds
into a string representation of the date. It also parses the string back to the
internal Date representation in milliseconds.

```cpp
DateFormat* df = DateFormat::createDateInstance();
UnicodeString myString;
UDate myDateArr[] = { 0.0, 100000000.0, 2000000000.0 };
for (int32_t i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
  myString.remove();
  cout << df->format( myDateArr[i], myString ) << endl;
}
```

To format a date for a different Locale, specify it in the call to:

```cpp
DateFormat* df = DateFormat::createDateInstance
   ( DateFormat::SHORT, Locale::getFrance());
```

### Parsing Dates

Use a DateFormat to parse also:

```cpp
UErrorCode status = ZERO_ERROR;
UDate myDate = df->parse(myString, status);
```

When numeric fields abut one another directly, with no intervening delimiter
characters, they constitute a run of abutting numeric fields. Such runs are
parsed specially. For example, the format "HHmmss" parses the input text
"123456" to 12:34:56, parses the input text "12345" to 1:23:45, and fails to
parse "1234". In other words, the leftmost field of the run is flexible, while
the others keep a fixed width. If the parse fails anywhere in the run, then the
leftmost field is shortened by one character, and the entire run is parsed
again. This is repeated until either the parse succeeds or the leftmost field is
one character in length. If the parse still fails at that point, the parse of
the run fails.

### Producing Normal Date Formats for a Locale

Use createDateInstance to produce the normal date format for that country. There
are other static factory methods available. Use createTimeInstance to produce
the normal time format for that country. Use createDateTimeInstance to produce a
DateFormat that formats both date and time. You can pass different options to
these factory methods to control the length of the result; from SHORT to MEDIUM
to LONG to FULL. The exact result depends on the locale, but generally:

1.  SHORT is numeric, such as 12/13/52 or 3:30pm

2.  MEDIUM is longer, such as Jan. 12, 1952

3.  LONG is longer, such as January 12, 1952 or 3:30:32pm

4.  FULL is completely specified, such as Tuesday, April 12, 1952 AD or
    3:30:42pm PST

For more general flexibility, the [DateTimePatternGenerator](index.md) can map a
custom selection of time and date fields, along with various display styles for
those fields, to a locale-appropriate format that can then be set as the format
to use by the DateFormat.

### Producing Relative Date Formats for a Locale

ICU currently provides limited support for formatting dates using a “relative”
style, specified using RELATIVE_SHORT, RELATIVE_MEDIUM, RELATIVE_LONG. or
RELATIVE_FULL. As currently implemented, relative date formatting only affects
the formatting of dates within a limited range of calendar days before or after
the current date, based on the CLDR `<field type="day">`/`<relative>` data: For
example, in English, "Yesterday", "Today", and "Tomorrow". Within this range,
the specific relative style currently makes no difference. Outside of this
range, relative dates are formatted using the corresponding non-relative style
(SHORT, MEDIUM, etc.). Relative time styles are not currently supported, and
behave just like the corresponding non-relative style.

### Setting Time Zones

You can set the time zone on the format. If you want more control over the
format or parsing, cast the DateFormat you get from the factory methods to a
SimpleDateFormat. This works for the majority of countries.

> :point_right: **Note**: *Remember to check getDynamicClassID() before carrying out the cast.*

### Working with Positions

You can also use forms of the parse and format methods with ParsePosition and
FieldPosition to enable you to:

1.  Progressively parse through pieces of a string.

2.  Align any particular field, or find out where it is for selection on the
    screen.

## SimpleDateFormat

SimpleDateFormat is a concrete class used for formatting and parsing dates in a
language-independent manner. It allows for formatting, parsing, and
normalization. It formats or parses a date or time, which is the standard
milliseconds since 24:00 GMT, Jan. 1, 1970.

SimpleDateFormat is the only built-in implementation of DateFormat. It provides
a programmable interface that can be used to produce formatted dates and times
in a wide variety of formats. The formats include almost all of the most common
ones.

Create a date-time formatter using the following methods rather than
constructing an instance of SimpleDateFormat. In this way, the program is
guaranteed to get an appropriate formatting pattern of the locale.

1.  DateFormat::getInstance()

2.  getDateInstance()

3.  getDateTimeInstance()

If you need a more unusual pattern, construct a SimpleDateFormat directly and
give it an appropriate pattern.

### Date/Time Format Syntax

A date pattern is a string of characters, where specific strings of characters
are replaced with date and time data from a calendar when formatting or used to
generate data for a calendar when parsing.

The Date Field Symbol Table below contains the characters used in patterns to
show the appropriate formats for a given locale, such as yyyy for the year.
Characters may be used multiple times. For example, if y is used for the year,
'yy' might produce '99', whereas 'yyyy' produces '1999'. For most numerical
fields, the number of characters specifies the field width. For example, if h is
the hour, 'h' might produce '5', but 'hh' produces '05'. For some characters,
the count specifies whether an abbreviated or full form should be used, but may
have other choices, as given below.

Two single quotes represents a literal single quote, either inside or outside
single quotes. Text within single quotes is not interpreted in any way (except
for two adjacent single quotes). Otherwise all ASCII letter from a to z and A to
Z are reserved as syntax characters, and require quoting if they are to
represent literal characters. In addition, certain ASCII punctuation characters
may become variable in the future (eg ":" being interpreted as the time
separator and '/' as a date separator, and replaced by respective
locale-sensitive characters in display).

"Stand Alone" values refer to those designed to stand on their own, as opposed
to being with other formatted values. "2nd quarter" would use the stand alone
format (QQQQ), whereas "2nd quarter 2007" would use the regular format (qqqq
yyyy).

The pattern characters used in the Date Field Symbol Table are defined by CLDR;
for more information see [CLDR Date Field Symbol Table](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).
Note that the examples may not reflect current CLDR data.

### Time Zone Display Names

ICU supports time zone display names defined by the LDML ([Unicode Locale Data
Markup Language](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/) ) specification. Since
ICU 3.8, the vast majority of localized time zone names are no longer associated
with individual time zones. Instead, a set of localized time zone names are
associated with a *metazone* and one or more individual time zones are mapped to
the same *metazone*. For example, *metazone* “America_Pacific” has its own
display name data such as “PST” “PDT” “PT” “Pacific Standard Time” “Pacific
Daylight Time” “Pacific Time” and these names are shared by multiple individual
time zones “America/Los_Angeles”, “America/Vancouver”, “America/Tijuana” and so
on. The mapping from individual time zone to *metazone* is not a simple 1-to-1
mapping, but it changes time to time. For example, time zone
“America/Indiana/Tell_City” uses name data from *metazone* “America_Eastern”
until April 2, 2006, but it changes to *metazone* “America_Central” after the
date. So the display name used for “America/Indiana/Tell_City” before the date
(e.g. “Eastern Time”) differs from the one after the date (e.g. “Central Time).

> :point_right: **Note**: *Prior to ICU 3.8, a localized time zone name (except GMT format) and a time
zone ID was in 1-to-1 relationship always. Therefore, a time zone name produced
by DateFormat can be parsed back to the original time zone. This assumption no
longer applies to ICU 3.8 and later releases for all time zone format types. If
you program requires to roundtrip specific time zone ID, you must use the
generic location format (“VVVV”) explained below.*

There are several different display name types available in the LDML
specification.

#### Time Zone Display Name Types

| Type | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generic non-location | Reflects wall time, suited for displaying recurring events, meetings or anywhere people do not want to be overly specific. Available in two length options – long and short. | Pacific Time<br/>PT |
| Generic partial location | Reflects wall time, used as a fallback format when the generic non-location format is not specific enough. A generic partial location name is constructed from a generic non-location name with a location name. For example, “PT” is shared by multiple time zones via metazone “America_Pacific”. When GMT offset in the time zone at the given time differs from the preferred time zone of the metazone for the locale, location name is appended to generic non-location name to distinguish the time zone from the preferred zone. Available in two length options – long and short. | Pacific Time (Canada)<br/>PT (Yellowknife) |
| Generic location | Reflects wall time, suited for populating choice list for time zones. If the time zone is the single time zone available in the region (country), the generic location name is constructed with the region name. Otherwise, the name is constructed from the region name and the city name. Unlike other format types, this name is unique per time zone. | United States (Los Angeles) Time<br/>Italy Time |
| Specific non-location | Reflects a specific standard or daylight time. Available in two length options – long and short. | Pacific Standard Time<br/>PDT |
| Localized GMT | A constant, specific offset from GMT in a localized form. | GMT-08:00 |
| RFC822 GMT | A constant, specific offset from GMT in a locale insensitive format. | -0800 |

Each format type in the above table is used as a primary type or a fallback in
SimpleDateFormat. The table below explains how ICU time zone format pattern work
and its characteristics.

#### Time Zone Pattern Usage

| Pattern | Behavior | Round-trip time at daylight transitions(\*) | Round-trip Time Zone | Suggested Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| z, zz, zzz | Short specific non-location format (e.g. “PST”).If the localized data is not available or the short abbreviation is not commonly used for the locale, localized GMT format is used (e.g. GMT-08:00). | yes | no | For displaying a time with a user friendly time zone name. |
| zzzz | Long specific non-location format (e.g. “Pacific Standard Time”).If the localized data is not available, localized GMT format is used (e.g. GMT-08:00). | yes | no | Same as “z”, but longer format. |
| v | Short generic non-location format (e.g. “PT”).If the localized data is not available or the short abbreviation is not commonly used for the locale, generic location format (e.g. “United States(Los Angeles) Time”) is used.If the localized data comes from metazone and the GMT offset at the given time in the specified time zone differs from the preferred time zone of the metazone for the locale, generic partial location format (e.g. “PT (Canada)”) is used. | no | no | For displaying a recurring wall time (e.g. events, meetings) or anywhere people do not want to be overly specific. |
| vvvv | Long generic non-location format (e.g. “Pacific Time”).If the localized data is not available, generic location format (e.g. “United States(Los Angeles) Time”) is used. | no | no | Same as “v”, but longer format. |
| V | Same as “z”, except using the short abbreviation even it is not commonly used for the locale. | yes | no | Same as “z”. |
| VVVV | Generic location format (e.g. “United States (Los Angeles) Time”). | no | yes | For populating a choice list for time zones, because it supports 1-to-1 name/zone ID mapping and is more uniform than other text formats.Also, this is only the pattern supporting time zone round-trip. If your program requires to preserve the original time zone information, use this pattern. |
| Z, ZZ, ZZZ | Localized GMT format (e.g. “GMT-08:00”). | yes | no | For displaying a time in UI in a uniformed manner. |
| ZZZZ | RFC822 GMT format (e.g. “-0800”). | yes | no | For formatting a time for non-user-facing data. |

\* At a transition from daylight saving time to standard time, there is a wall
time interval occurs twice.

## DateTimePatternGenerator

The DateTimePatternGenerator class provides a way to map a request for a set of
date/time fields, along with their width, to a locale-appropriate format
pattern. The request is in the form of a “skeleton” which just contains pattern
letters for the desired fields using the representation for the desired width.
In a skeleton, anything other than a pattern letter is ignored, field order is
insignificant, and there are two special additional pattern letters that may be
used: 'j' requests the preferred hour-cycle type for the locale (it gets mapped
to one of 'H', 'h', 'k', or 'K'); 'J' is similar but requests no AM/PM marker
even if the locale’s preferred hour-cycle type is 'h' or 'K'.

For example, a skeleton of “MMMMdjmm” might result in the following format
patterns for different locales:

| locale | format pattern for skeleton “MMMMdjmm” | example            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| en_US  | "MMMM d  'at'  h:mm a"                 | April 2 at 5:00 PM |
| es_ES  | "d 'de' MMMM, H:mm"                    | 2 de abril, 17:00  |
| ja_JP  | "M月d日 H:mm"                            | 4月2日 17:00         |

The most important DateTimePatternGenerator methods are the varieties of
getBestPattern.

Note that the fields in the format pattern may be adjusted as appropriate for
the locale and may not exactly match those in the skeleton. For example:

*   In Russian (locale "ru"), the skeleton "yMMMM" will produce the format
    pattern "LLLL y" (or "LLLL y 'г'.") since a month name without a day number
    must be in nominative form, as indicated by LLLL.
*   When using the Japanese calendar in the Japanese locale (locale
    "ja@calendar=japanese"), the skeleton "yMMMd" will produce the format
    pattern "Gy年M月d日" since the era must always be shown with the year in the
    Japanese calendar.

## DateFormatSymbols

DateFormatSymbols is a public class for encapsulating localizable date-time
formatting data, including time zone data. DateFormatSymbols is used by
DateFormat and SimpleDateFormat.

DateFormatSymbols specifies the exact character strings to use for various parts
of a date or time For example, the names of the months and days of the week, the
strings for AM and PM and the day of the week considered to be the first day of
the week (used in drawing calendar grids) are controlled by DateFormatSymbols.

Create a date-time formatter using the `createTimeInstance`, `createDateInstance`,
or `createDateTimeInstance` methods in DateFormat. Each of these methods can
return a date/time formatter initialized with a default format pattern, along
with the date-time formatting data for a given or default locale. After a
formatter is created, modify the format pattern using `applyPattern`.

If you want to create a date-time formatter with a particular format pattern and
locale, use one of the SimpleDateFormat constructors:

```cpp
UnicodeString aPattern("GyyyyMMddHHmmssSSZ", "");
new SimpleDateFormat(aPattern, new DateFormatSymbols(Locale::getUS())
```

This loads the appropriate date-time formatting data from the locale.s
