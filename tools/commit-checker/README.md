# Commit Checker Tool

This tool checks the ICU Git repository against the ICU Jira issue tracker to ensure that the two are consistent with one another.

Author: Shane Carr

## Installation

Install `pipenv` globally:

	$ sudo pip3 install pipenv

Install this project's dependencies locally:

	$ pipenv install

Optional: save your Jira credentials in a `.env` file in this directory:

	JIRA_USERNAME=hello
	JIRA_PASSWORD=world

This is required if you want to process sensitive tickets.

## Usage

Make sure you have updated your repository:

	$ git pull upstream master

Run the tool and save the result into REPORT.md:

	$ pipenv run python3 check.py > REPORT.md

Open a pull request so others can view the report easilly.
