      <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Resource Bundle Reporter</H1>
      <H1 ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/screenshots/RBReporter.gif" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="600"></H1>
      <H4 ALIGN="LEFT">What is RBReporter?</H4>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Frequently, managers and developers working on an inernationalized 
        product request the ability to quickly view the status and progress of 
        the translation efforts in their project. RBReporter generates such reports 
        on a periodic basis and stores them to a specified location in a variety 
        of formats. The information included in the reports includes the names 
        and meta data associated with each of the resource files, the number or 
        resources held in each file, the number of untranslated resources in each 
        file, and, if the detail level is set to 'High,' a list of all of the 
        untranslated resource keys for each file.</P>
      <H4 ALIGN="LEFT">How is RBReporter started?</H4>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">From the command line, RBReporter is run by typing in the 
        following command:</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT"><CODE>java com.ibm.rbm.RBReporter</CODE></P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">This will bring up the window seen above. Alternatively, 
        Windows users can run the batch file RBReporter.bat. RBReporter will also 
        take command line arguments that will run the program in a variety of 
        modes. An equivalent command line argument to the one above is:</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT"><CODE>java com.ibm.rbm.RBReporter -gui</CODE></P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">This argument works the same as the first, bringing up the 
        Graphical User Interface. This is the only way to set the properties of 
        the reporter, such as the bundle to report on, the types of reports generated, 
        and the interval between report generation.</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Another option is to run the reporter with the following 
        argument:</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT"><CODE>java com.ibm.rbm.RBReporter -now</CODE></P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">When the -now option is used, the interval setting between 
        reports is ignored, and the reports are generated immediately according 
        to the other saved settings. This option does not bring up the window 
        for changing settings. Using this option is helpful if you would like 
        to use you operating system instead of RBReporter to schedule the generation 
        of reports.</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The last option is the following:</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT"><code>java com.ibm.rbm.RBReporter -line</CODE></P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">When this option is used, the reporter is run through the 
        command line only. None of the settings will be accessible for changing. 
        Whenever it is time for a report to be generated, a message will appear 
        on the command line. Another message will appear when the reports have 
        been successfully written. This last message will include the date and 
        time of the next report generation.</P>
      <H4 ALIGN="LEFT">What do the settings mean?</H4>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">When the graphical user interface is initially brought up, 
        the reporter may not be active. An indication at the top of the window 
        indicates whether or not the reporter will report at the time that has 
        been specified. The 'Started' message does not indicate that report generation 
        has started; it merely indicates that the reporter has started and will 
        generate reports according to the other settings. To toggle whether or 
        not the reporter is running press the 'Start' or 'Stop' button near the 
        top of the window. To generate a report immediately, press the 'Update 
        Now' button.</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The report interval determines when a report is generated. 
        There are two main options for determining the interval. Either an amount 
        of time is specified that must pass in between reports, or a specific 
        time during the week or day is specified at which time the report is generated 
        regardless of when the last report was generated.</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The Resource Bundle setting is an indication of the base 
        file from concerning which the report is generated. To change the base 
        file, either type in the new file path to a resource bundle, or select 
        the 'Choose' button immediately to the right to bring up the graphical 
        file chooser. The output directory is the file directory into which the 
        reports are saved. Note that the reports are overwritten each time they 
        are newly generated.</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The output format has three options. Any combination of 
        these options is permissible, though it makes little sense to turn them 
        all off. The 'Text' format produces a simple text file in English reporting 
        on the status of each of the resource files. The 'HTML' format produces 
        a page that is viewable in a web browser. The 'XML' format produces a 
        well formed XML report that can be imported into a database, transformed 
        into another format, or used in a variety of other ways.</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Each output format has associated with it a file name. This 
        name can be chosen as appropriate for the project to which the bundle 
        belongs. Also, these file names can be modified in order to place the 
        files in a directory other than the one specified in the output directory. 
        For instance, a UNIX user might change the text file name to '../../log/report.txt'. 
        A detail level is also associated with each report. The 'High' detail 
        level merely includes each of the resource keys that are untranslated 
        or duplicated instead of just reporting the number of such resources.</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The last button saves the settings currently being displayed 
        to a preferences file so that these settings will be in place the next 
        time the program is run. If the settings are not meant to be saved as 
        such, do not click this button. The reporter will still run according 
        to the displayed settings as long as the RBReporter program is running.</P>
      <H4 ALIGN="LEFT">What is the code scan?</H4>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Starting with version 0.3a, the reporter included a function 
        that can scan text files looking for instances of resource bundle usage 
        and compare those instances with the selected resource bundle. This scan 
        can then report on any resource keys called on by a program but not existing 
        in a resource bundle, as well as point out resources in the bundle that 
        are potentially not used at all by the code.</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The reporter is turned on by selecting the check box next 
        to the text 'Scan Code File' and pointing the scan to a properly specified 
        scan XML file. The report generated is appended to the normal reports 
        generated in text, HTML, or XML. The report is also sensitive to the detail 
        level selected for each of these three output formats.</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The scan XML file provides the configuration information 
        for the code scan. In it rules for what directories and files to scan 
        are set as well as what type of text is looked for to find a resource 
        key. More <A HREF="scanfile.html">detailed information on setting up a 
        scan XML file</A> can be found by following the link.</P>
