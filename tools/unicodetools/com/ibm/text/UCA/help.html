<h2 align="center">UCA Chart Help</h2>
<p>This set of charts shows the Unicode Collation Algorithm values for Unicode 
characters. The characters are arranged in the following groups:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
  <tr>
    <th align="left"><i>Null</i></th>
    <th class="x">Completely ignoreable (primary, secondary and tertiary levels)<br>
      These include control codes and various formatting codes.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"><i>Ignorable</i></th>
    <th class="x">Ignorable at a primary level, but not at a secondary or 
      tertiary level.<br>
      These include most accents and diacritics.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"><i>Variable</i></th>
    <th class="x">Characters that may be set to ignorable by a programmatic 
      switch.<br>
      These include spaces, punctuation marks, and most symbols.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"><i>Common</i></th>
    <th class="x">Characters that are none of the above, but not considered 
      letters.<br>
      These include numbers, currency symbols, etc.</th>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"><i>Letters</i></th>
    <th class="x">According to script</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"><i>Unsupported</i></th>
    <th class="x">Not explicitly supported in this version of UCA; uses 
      code-point order</th>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The characters* within each group are arranged in cells. The color of the 
cell indicates the strength of the difference between that character and the <i>previous</i> 
character in the chart, as follows.</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2"><font size="3"><u>No Expansion</u></font>
    <th rowspan="5">&nbsp;
    <th colspan="2"><font size="3"><u>Expansion</u></font>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="p">a<br>
      <tt>0061</tt></td>
    <th class="x">Primary difference
    <td class="ep">ǳ<br>
      <tt>01F3</tt></td>
    <th class="x">Primary difference</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="s">á<br>
      <tt>00E1</tt></td>
    <th class="x">Secondary Difference</th>
    <td class="es">Ǳ<br>

    <th class="x">Secondary Difference</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <th class="x">Tertiary difference</th>
    <td class="et">ǲ<br>
      <tt>01F2</tt></td>
    <th class="x">Tertiary difference</th>
  <tr>
    <td class="q">Å<br>
      <tt>212B</tt></td>
    <th class="x">Quarternary difference<br>
      or no difference</th>
    <td class="eq">&nbsp;</td>
    <th class="x">Quarternary difference<br>
      or no difference</th>
  </tr>
</table>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><b>Note: </b>If tool-tips are enabled in your browser, then if 
  you pause the mouse over any cell, you will see the name of the character and 
  a representation of the sort key. In this representation, the separators 
  between the weight levels are represented with &quot;|&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>*</th>
    <th class="x">In some cases, the UCA data table also includes contractions.<br>
      They can be recognized by the multiple code point numbers, as in the 
      following:</th>
    <td class="p">ஔ<br>
      <tt>0B92 0BD7</tt></td>
  </tr>

<h3><b>Notes</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The UCA results are versioned <i>both</i> by the version of the UCA <i>and</i> 
    by the version of The Unicode Standard used to process the data.</li>
  <li>These charts only provide one of the alternatives for handling variable 
    characters (punctuation), whereby these characters are <b>non-ignorable.</b></li>
  <li>Characters from large blocks, such as CJK-Ideographs, Hangul Syllables, 
    Private Use Area, etc. are represented by a sampling.</li>
  <li>Some unassigned code points, noncharacters and other edge cases are also 
    added to the list for comparison.</li>
