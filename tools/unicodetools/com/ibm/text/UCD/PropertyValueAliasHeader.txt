# This file contains aliases for property values used in the UCD.
# These names can be used for XML formats of UCD data, for regular-expression
# property tests, and other programmatic textual descriptions of Unicode data.
# The names are not normative, except where they correspond to normative property
# values in the UCD. For information on which properties are normative, see
# UnicodeCharacterDatabase.html.
#
# The names may be translated in appropriate environments, and additional
# aliases may be useful.
#
# FORMAT
#
# Each line describes a property value name.
# This consists of three fields, separated by semicolons.
#
# First Field: The first field describes the property for which that
# property value name is used.
# There is one special pseudo-property: "qc" stands for any quick-check property
#
# Second Field: The second field is an abbreviated name.
# If there is no abbreviated name available, the field is marked with "n/a".
#
# Third Field: The third field is a long name.
#
# In the case of ccc, their are 4 fields. The second field is numeric, third
# is abbreviated, and fourth is long.
#
# With loose matching of property names, the case distinctions, whitespace,
# and '_' are ignored.
#
# NOTE: The Block property values are in Blocks.txt, and not repeated here.
# For more information on the use of blocks, see UTR #18: Regular Expression Guidelines
#
# NOTE: Currently there is at most one abbreviated name and one long name for
# property value. However, in the future additional aliases
# may be added. In such a case, the first line for the property value
# would have the preferred alias for output.
#
# NOTE: The property value names are NOT unique across properties, especially
# with loose matches. For example,
# AL means Arabic Letter for the Bidi_Class property, and
# AL means Alpha_Left for the Combining_Class property, and
# AL means Alphabetic for the Line_Break property.
#
# In addition, some property names may be the same as some property value names:
# cc means Combining_Class property, and
# cc means the General_Category property value Control (cc)
#
# The combination of property value and property name is, however, unique.
# For more information, see UTR #24: Regular Expression Guidelines
