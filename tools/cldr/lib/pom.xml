    <!-- This POM file acts as a parent POM file for any tool which is built
         via Maven and requires access to the CLDR data APIs. This POM file
         and the other files in this directory encapsulate the somewhat messy
         task of including the Ant-built CLDR JAR file in Maven projects. -->

    <!-- Important: The "${project.basedir}" property is the directory of the
         child POM file, not this directory (and there's no easy way in Maven
         to identify the absolute path of a parent POM file). However since
         child POM files should have a <parent> declaration with the relative
         path in it, we can use that. Note however that this is a bit fragile
         and relies on <relativePath> being a directory, not a POM file.
         
         In order to allow the local repository to work either when it is used
         by a child POM file or when it's used directly (e.g. for installing
         or purging the cache) when it is invoked from this directory, the
           -Dproject.parent.relativePath=""
         argument must be given. -->
