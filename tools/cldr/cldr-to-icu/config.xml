        <!-- The primary set of locale IDs to be generated by default. The IDs in this list are
             automatically expanded to include default scripts and all available regions. The
             rules are:

             1) Base languages are expanded to include default scripts (e.g. "en" -> "en_Latn").
             2) All region and variant subtags are added for any base language or language+script
                (e.g. "en" -> "en_GB" or "shi_Latn" -> "shi_Latn_MA").

             If a non-default script is desired it should be listed explicitly (e.g. "sr_Latn").

             Locale IDs with deprecated subtags (which become aliases) must still be listed in
             full (e.g. "en_RH" or "sr_Latn_YU").

        <!-- The following elements configure directories in which a subset of the available
             locales IDs should be generated. Unlike the main <localeId> element, these
             filters must specify all locale IDs in full (but since they mostly select base
             languages, this isn't a big deal).

             As well as allowing some data directories to have a subset of available data (via
             the <localeIds> element) there are also mechanisms for controlling aliasing and
             the locale parent relation which allows the sharing of some ICU data in cases
             where it would otherwise need to be copied. The two mechanisms are:

             1: inheritLanguageSubtag: Used to rewrite the parent of a locale ID from "root" to
                its language subtag (e.g. "zh_Hant" has a natural parent of "root", but to allow
                some base language data to be shared it can be made to have a parent of "zh").

             2: forcedAlias: Used to add aliases for specific directories in order to affect the
                ICU behaviour in special cases.

             Between them these mechanisms are known as "tailorings" of the affected locales. -->
        <!-- TODO: Explain why these special cases are needed/different. -->

        <!-- Collation data is large, but also more sharable than other data, which is why there
             are a number of aliases and parent remappings for this directory. -->

            <!-- These aliases are to avoid needing to copy and maintain the same collation data

                 "zh_Hans_CN"), and for "yue" it's "yue_Hant_HK" (vs "zh_Hant_HK"), so the

        <!-- GLOBAL ALIASES -->

        <!-- Some spoken languages (e.g. "ars") inherit all their data from a written language
             (e.g. "ar_SA"). However CLDR doesn't currently support a way to represent that
             relationship. Unlike deprecated languages for which an alias can be inferred from
             the "languageAlias" CLDR data, there's no way in CLDR to represent the fact that
             we want "ars" (a non-deprecated language) to inherit the data of "ar_SA".

             This alias is the first example of potentially many cases where ICU needs to
             generate an alias in order to affect "sideways inheritance" for spoken languages,
             and at some stage it should probably be supported properly in the CLDR data. -->

             not in CLDR. If we do not do this, then including it in localeIds will generate
             empty no_Latn and no_Latn_NO and then no_NO aliasing to no_Latn_NO. -->

        <!-- ALTERNATE VALUES -->

        <!-- The following elements configure alternate values for some special case paths.
             The target path will only be replaced if both it, and the source path, exist in
             the CLDR data (paths will not be modified if only the source path exists).

             Since the paths must represent the same semantic type of data, they must be in the
             same "namespace" (same element names) and must not contain value attributes. Thus
             they can only differ by distinguishing attributes (either added or modified).

             This feature is typically used to select alternate translations (e.g. short forms)
             for certain paths. -->

         indiciating that it was automatically generated, before deleting it.

         If unexpected files are found, the "clean" task will fail without deleting anything
         (unless'forceDelete' is set to override this). Note that even if 'forceDelete' is set,
         the files listed explicitly below will never be deleted by this process.
